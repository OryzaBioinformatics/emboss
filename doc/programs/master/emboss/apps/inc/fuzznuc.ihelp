Version: EMBOSS:6.3.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Nucleotide sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
   -pattern            pattern    The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the
                                  nucleotides are used.
                                  The symbol 'n' is used for a position where
                                  any nucleotide is accepted.
                                  Ambiguities are indicated by listing the
                                  acceptable nucleotides for a given position,
                                  between square parentheses '[ ]'. For
                                  example: [ACG] stands for A or C or G.
                                  Ambiguities are also indicated by listing
                                  between a pair of curly brackets '{ }' the
                                  nucleotides that are not accepted at a given
                                  position. For example: {AG} stands for any
                                  nucleotides except A and G.
                                  Each element in a pattern is separated from
                                  its neighbor by a '-'. (Optional in
                                  fuzznuc).
                                  Repetition of an element of the pattern can
                                  be indicated by following that element with
                                  a numerical value or a numerical range
                                  between parenthesis. Examples: N(3)
                                  corresponds to N-N-N, N(2,4) corresponds to
                                  N-N or N-N-N or N-N-N-N.
                                  When a pattern is restricted to either the
                                  5' or 3' end of a sequence, that pattern
                                  either starts with a '<' symbol or
                                  respectively ends with a '>' symbol.
                                  A period ends the pattern. (Optional in
                                  fuzznuc).
                                  For example, [CG](5)TG{A}N(1,5)C
  [-outfile]           report     [*.fuzznuc] Output report file name
