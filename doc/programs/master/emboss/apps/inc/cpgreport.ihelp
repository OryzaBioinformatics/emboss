Version: EMBOSS:6.3.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Nucleotide sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)

                                  sequence found. A value of 17 is more
                                  sensitive, but 28 has also been used with
                                  some success. (Integer from 1 to 200)
