Version: EMBOSS:6.2.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-estsequence]       seqall     Spliced EST nucleotide sequence(s)
  [-genomesequence]    sequence   Unspliced genomic nucleotide sequence
  [-outfile]           outfile    [*.est2genome] Output file name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -match              integer    [1] Score for matching two bases (Any
                                  integer value)
   -mismatch           integer    [1] Cost for mismatching two bases (Any
                                  integer value)
   -gappenalty         integer    [2] Cost for deleting a single base in
                                  either sequence, excluding introns (Any
                                  integer value)
   -intronpenalty      integer    [40] Cost for an intron, independent of
                                  length. (Any integer value)
   -splicepenalty      integer    [20] Cost for an intron, independent of
                                  length and starting/ending on donor-acceptor
                                  sites (Any integer value)
   -minscore           integer    [30] Exclude alignments with scores below
                                  this threshold score. (Any integer value)

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -reverse            boolean    Reverse the orientation of the EST sequence
   -[no]usesplice      boolean    [Y] Use donor and acceptor splice sites. If
                                  you want to ignore donor-acceptor sites then
                                  set this to be false.
   -mode               menu       [both] This determines the comparion mode.
                                  The default value is 'both', in which case
                                  both strands of the est are compared
                                  assuming a forward gene direction (ie GT/AG
                                  splice sites), and the best comparsion
                                  redone assuming a reversed (CT/AC) gene
                                  splicing direction. The other allowed modes
                                  are 'forward', when just the forward strand
                                  is searched, and 'reverse', ditto for the
                                  reverse strand. (Values: both (Both
                                  strands); forward (Forward strand only);
                                  reverse (Reverse strand only))
   -[no]best           boolean    [Y] You can print out all comparisons
                                  instead of just the best one by setting this
                                  to be false.
   -space              float      [10.0] For linear-space recursion. If
                                  product of sequence lengths divided by 4
                                  exceeds this then a divide-and-conquer
                                  strategy is used to control the memory
                                  requirements. In this way very long
                                  sequences can be aligned.
                                  If you have a machine with plenty of memory
                                  you can raise this parameter (but do not
                                  exceed the machine's physical RAM) (Any
                                  numeric value)
   -shuffle            integer    [0] Shuffle (Any integer value)
   -seed               integer    [20825] Random number seed (Any integer
                                  value)
   -align              boolean    Show the alignment. The alignment includes
                                  the first and last 5 bases of each intron,
                                  together with the intron width. The
                                  direction of splicing is indicated by angle
                                  brackets (forward or reverse) or ????
                                  (unknown).
   -width              integer    [50] Alignment width (Any integer value)
