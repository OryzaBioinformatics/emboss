   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Nucleotide sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
  [-seqcomp]           string     Overlap sequence (Any string)

   -mfile              datafile   [Emethylsites.dat] Restriction enzyme
                                  methylation data file
   -min                integer    [1] Minimum cuts per RE (Integer from 1 to
                                  1000)

                                  to 2000000000)
   -single             boolean    [N] Force single site only cuts
   -threeprime         boolean    [N] Use 3' overhang e.g. BamHI has CTAG as a
                                  5' overhang, and ApaI has CCGG as 3'
                                  overhang.

   -methylation        boolean    [N] If this is set then RE recognition sites
                                  will not match methylated bases.
   -[no]commercial     boolean    [Y] Only enzymes with suppliers
   -html               boolean    [N] Create HTML output
