The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
command-line qualifier <b>-aformat xxx</b>, where 'xxx' is replaced by
the name of the required format.  Some of the alignment formats can cope
with an unlimited number of sequences, while others are only for pairs
of sequences.  

<p>

The available multiple alignment format names are: unknown, multiple,
simple, fasta, msf, trace, srs

<p>

The available pairwise alignment format names are: pair, markx0, markx1,
markx2, markx3, markx10, srspair, score
