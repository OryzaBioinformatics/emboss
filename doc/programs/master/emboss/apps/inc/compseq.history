5 April 2001 (version 1.12.0) - the operation of the option '-reverse'
has changed.  It is now 'False' by default instead of being 'True' by
default for nucleic sequences.  Too many people were getting confused by
the counts being done on both senses, so this is now done on only the
forward sense by default.
