name: Haplotype inference
namespace: operation
def: Infer haplotypes, either alleles at multiple loci that are transmitted together on the same chromosome, or a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a single chromatid that are statistically associated.
comment: Haplotype inference can help in population genetic studies and the identification of complex disease genes, , and is typically based on aligned single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) fragments. Haplotype comparison is a useful way to characterize the genetic variation between individuals. An individual's haplotype describes which nucleotide base occurs at each position for a set of common SNPs. Tools might use combinatorial functions (for example parsimony) or a likelihood function or model with optimization such as minimum error correction (MEC) model, expectation-maximization algorithm (EM), genetic algorithm or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
