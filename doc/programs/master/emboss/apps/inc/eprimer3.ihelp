                                  The file must be in (a slightly restricted)
                                  FASTA format (W. B. Pearson and D.J. Lipman,
                                  PNAS 85:8 pp 2444-2448 [1988]); we briefly
                                  discuss the organization of this file below.
                                  If this parameter is specified then
                                  EPrimer3 locally aligns each candidate oligo
                                  against each library sequence and rejects
                                  those primers for which the local alignment
                                  score times a specified weight (see below)
                                  exceeds INTERNAL-OLIGO-MAX-MISHYB. (The
                                  maximum value of the weight is arbitrarily
                                  set to 12.0.)
                                  Each sequence entry in the FASTA-format file
                                  must begin with an 'id line' that starts
                                  with '>'. The contents of the id line is
                                  'slightly restricted' in that EPrimer3
                                  parses everything after any optional
                                  asterisk ('*') as a floating point number to
                                  use as the weight mentioned above. If the
                                  id line contains no asterisk then the weight
                                  defaults to 1.0. The alignment scoring
                                  system used is the same as for calculating
                                  complementarity among oligos (e.g.
                                  SELF-ANY). The remainder of an entry
                                  contains the sequence as lines following the
                                  id line up until a line starting with '>'
                                  or the end of the file. Whitespace and
                                  newlines are ignored. Characters 'A', 'T',
                                  'G', 'C', 'a', 't', 'g', 'c' are retained
                                  and any other character is converted to 'N'
                                  (with the consequence that any IUB / IUPAC
                                  codes for ambiguous bases are converted to
                                  'N'). There are no restrictions on line
                                  length.
                                  An empty value for this parameter indicates
                                  that no library should be used.
   -numreturn          integer    [5] The maximum number of primer pairs to
                                  return. Primer pairs returned are sorted by
                                  their 'quality', in other words by the value
                                  of the objective function (where a lower
                                  number indicates a better primer pair).
                                  Caution: setting this parameter to a large
                                  value will increase running time. (Integer 0
                                  or more)
   -includedregion     range      [(full sequence)] A sub-region of the given
                                  sequence in which to pick primers. For
                                  example, often the first dozen or so bases
                                  of a sequence are vector, and should be
                                  excluded from consideration. The value for
                                  this parameter has the form
                                  (start),(end)
                                  where (start) is the index of the first base
                                  to consider, and (end) is the last in the
                                  primer-picking region.
   -target             range      [(full sequence)] If one or more Targets is
                                  specified then a legal primer pair must
                                  flank at least one of them. A Target might
                                  be a simple sequence repeat site (for
                                  example a CA repeat) or a single-base-pair
                                  polymorphism. The value should be a
                                  space-separated list of
                                  (start),(end)
                                  pairs where (start) is the index of the
                                  first base of a Target, and (end) is the
                                  last
                                  E.g. 50,51 requires primers to surround the
                                  2 bases at positions 50 and 51.
   -excludedregion     range      [(full sequence)] Primer oligos may not
                                  overlap any region specified in this tag.
                                  The associated value must be a
                                  space-separated list of
                                  (start),(end)
                                  pairs where (start) is the index of the
                                  first base of the excluded region, and and
                                  (end) is the last. This tag is useful for
                                  tasks such as excluding regions of low
                                  sequence quality or for excluding regions
                                  containing repetitive elements such as ALUs
                                  or LINEs.
                                  E.g. 401,407 68,70 forbids selection of
                                  primers in the 7 bases starting at 401 and
                                  the 3 bases at 68.
   -forwardinput       string     The sequence of a forward primer to check
                                  and around which to design reverse primers
                                  and optional internal oligos. Must be a
                                  substring of SEQUENCE. (Any string is
                                  accepted)
   -reverseinput       string     The sequence of a reverse primer to check
                                  and around which to design forward primers
                                  and optional internal oligos. Must be a
                                  substring of the reverse strand of SEQUENCE.
                                  (Any string is accepted)
*  -gcclamp            integer    [0] Require the specified number of
                                  consecutive Gs and Cs at the 3' end of both
                                  the forward and reverse primer. (This
                                  parameter has no effect on the internal
                                  oligo if one is requested.) (Integer 0 or
                                  more)
*  -osize              integer    [20] Optimum length (in bases) of a primer
                                  oligo. EPrimer3 will attempt to pick primers
                                  close to this length. (Integer 0 or more)
*  -minsize            integer    [18] Minimum acceptable length of a primer.
                                  Must be greater than 0 and less than or
                                  equal to MAX-SIZE. (Integer 1 or more)
*  -maxsize            integer    [27] Maximum acceptable length (in bases) of
                                  a primer. Currently this parameter cannot
                                  be larger than 35. This limit is governed by
                                  the maximum oligo size for which EPrimer3's
                                  melting-temperature is valid. (Integer up
                                  to 35)
*  -otm                float      [60.0] Optimum melting temperature(Celsius)
                                  for a primer oligo. EPrimer3 will try to
                                  pick primers with melting temperatures are
                                  close to this temperature. The oligo melting
                                  temperature formula in EPrimer3 is that

*  -maxgc              float      [80.0] Maximum allowable percentage of Gs
                                  and Cs in any primer generated by Primer.

*  -saltconc           float      [50.0] The millimolar concentration of salt
                                  (usually KCl) in the PCR. EPrimer3 uses this
                                  argument to calculate oligo melting
                                  temperatures. (Any numeric value)
*  -dnaconc            float      [50.0] The nanomolar concentration of
                                  annealing oligos in the PCR. EPrimer3 uses
                                  this argument to calculate oligo melting
                                  temperatures. The default (50nM) works well
                                  with the standard protocol used at the
                                  Whitehead/MIT Center for Genome

                                  template, 0.025 units/microliter Taq
                                  polymerase in 0.1 mM each dNTP, 1.5mM MgCl2,
                                  50mM KCl, 10mM Tris-HCL (pH 9.3) using 35
                                  cycles with an annealing temperature of 56
                                  degrees Celsius. This parameter corresponds
                                  to 'c' in Rychlik, Spencer and Rhoads'
                                  equation (ii) (Nucleic Acids Research, vol
                                  18, num 12) where a suitable value (for a
                                  lower initial concentration of template) is
                                  'empirically determined'. The value of this
                                  parameter is less than the actual
                                  concentration of oligos in the reaction
                                  because it is the concentration of annealing
                                  oligos, which in turn depends on the amount
                                  of template (including PCR product) in a
                                  given cycle. This concentration increases a
                                  great deal during a PCR; fortunately PCR
                                  seems quite robust for a variety of oligo

                                  bases (inclusive) then one would set this
                                  parameter to 100-150. If one desires PCR
                                  products in either the range from 100 to 150
                                  bases or in the range from 200 to 250 bases
                                  then one would set this parameter to

                                  restricted) FASTA format (W. B. Pearson and
                                  D.J. Lipman, PNAS 85:8 pp 2444-2448 [1988]);
                                  we briefly discuss the organization of this
                                  file below. If this parameter is specified
                                  then EPrimer3 locally aligns each candidate
                                  primer against each library sequence and
                                  rejects those primers for which the local
                                  alignment score times a specified weight
                                  (see below) exceeds MAX-MISPRIMING. (The
                                  maximum value of the weight is arbitrarily
                                  set to 100.0.)
                                  Each sequence entry in the FASTA-format file
                                  must begin with an 'id line' that starts
                                  with '>'. The contents of the id line is
                                  'slightly restricted' in that EPrimer3
                                  parses everything after any optional
                                  asterisk ('*') as a floating point number to
                                  use as the weight mentioned above. If the
                                  id line contains no asterisk then the weight
                                  defaults to 1.0. The alignment scoring
                                  system used is the same as for calculating
                                  complementarity among oligos (e.g.
                                  SELF-ANY). The remainder of an entry
                                  contains the sequence as lines following the
                                  id line up until a line starting with '>'
                                  or the end of the file. Whitespace and
                                  newlines are ignored. Characters 'A', 'T',
                                  'G', 'C', 'a', 't', 'g', 'c' are retained
                                  and any other character is converted to 'N'
                                  (with the consequence that any IUB / IUPAC
                                  codes for ambiguous bases are converted to
                                  'N'). There are no restrictions on line
                                  length.
                                  An empty value for this parameter indicates
                                  that no repeat library should be used.
   -explainflag        boolean    [N] If this flag is true, produce
                                  LEFT-EXPLAIN, RIGHT-EXPLAIN, and
                                  INTERNAL-OLIGO-EXPLAIN output tags, which
                                  are intended to provide information on the
                                  number of oligos and primer pairs that
                                  EPrimer3 examined, and statistics on the
                                  number discarded for various reasons.
   -fileflag           boolean    [N] If the associated value is true, then
                                  EPrimer3 creates two output files for each
                                  input SEQUENCE. File (sequence-id).for lists
                                  all acceptable forward primers for
                                  (sequence-id), and (sequence-id).rev lists
                                  all acceptable reverse primers for
                                  (sequence-id), where (sequence-id) is the
                                  value of the SEQUENCE-ID tag (which must be
                                  supplied). In addition, if the input tag
                                  TASK is 1 or 4, EPrimer3 produces a file
                                  (sequence-id).int, which lists all
                                  acceptable internal oligos.
   -firstbaseindex     integer    [1] This parameter is the index of the first
                                  base in the input sequence. For input and
                                  output using 1-based indexing (such as that
                                  used in GenBank and to which many users are
                                  accustomed) set this parameter to 1. For
                                  input and output using 0-based indexing set
                                  this parameter to 0. (This parameter also
                                  affects the indexes in the contents of the
                                  files produced when the primer file flag is
                                  set.) (Any integer value)
   -pickanyway         boolean    [N] If true pick a primer pair even if
                                  LEFT-INPUT, RIGHT-INPUT, or
                                  INTERNAL-OLIGO-INPUT violates specific
                                  constraints.
   -maxmispriming      float      [12.00] The maximum allowed weighted
                                  similarity with any sequence in
                                  MISPRIMING-LIBRARY. (Number up to 9999.990)
   -pairmaxmispriming  float      [24.00] The maximum allowed sum of weighted
                                  similarities of a primer pair (one
                                  similarity for each primer) with any single
                                  sequence in MISPRIMING-LIBRARY. (Number up
                                  to 9999.990)
   -numnsaccepted      integer    [0] Maximum number of unknown bases (N)
                                  allowable in any primer. (Integer 0 or more)
   -selfany            float      [8.00] The maximum allowable local alignment
                                  score when testing a single primer for
                                  (local) self-complementarity and the maximum
                                  allowable local alignment score when
                                  testing for complementarity between forward
                                  and reverse primers. Local
                                  self-complementarity is taken to predict the
                                  tendency of primers to anneal to each other
                                  without necessarily causing self-priming in
                                  the PCR. The scoring system gives 1.00 for
                                  complementary bases, -0.25 for a match of
                                  any base (or N) with an N, -1.00 for a
                                  mismatch, and -2.00 for a gap. Only
                                  single-base-pair gaps are allowed. For
                                  example, the alignment

                                  is allowed (and yields a score of 1.75), but
                                  the alignment

                                  is not considered. Scores are non-negative,
                                  and a score of 0.00 indicates that there is
                                  no reasonable local alignment between two
                                  oligos. (Number from 0.000 to 9999.990)
   -selfend            float      [3.00] The maximum allowable 3'-anchored
                                  global alignment score when testing a single
                                  primer for self-complementarity, and the
                                  maximum allowable 3'-anchored global
                                  alignment score when testing for
                                  complementarity between forward and reverse
                                  primers. The 3'-anchored global alignment
                                  score is taken to predict the likelihood of
                                  PCR-priming primer-dimers, for example

                                  The scoring system is as for the Maximum
                                  Complementarity argument. In the examples
                                  above the scores are 7.00 and 6.00
                                  respectively. Scores are non-negative, and a
                                  score of 0.00 indicates that there is no
                                  reasonable 3'-anchored global alignment
                                  between two oligos. In order to estimate
                                  3'-anchored global alignments for candidate
                                  primers and primer pairs, Primer assumes
                                  that the sequence from which to choose
                                  primers is presented 5' to 3'. It is
                                  nonsensical to provide a larger value for
                                  this parameter than for the Maximum (local)
                                  Complementarity parameter because the score
                                  of a local alignment will always be at least
                                  as great as the score of a global
                                  alignment. (Number 0.000 or more)
   -maxendstability    float      [9.0] The maximum stability for the five 3'
                                  bases of a forward or reverse primer. Bigger
                                  numbers mean more stable 3' ends. The value
                                  is the maximum delta G for duplex
                                  disruption for the five 3' bases as
                                  calculated using the nearest neighbor

                                  backward compatibility (which we may change
                                  in the next release). Rychlik recommends a
