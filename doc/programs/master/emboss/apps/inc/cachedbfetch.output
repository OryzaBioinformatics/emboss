  comment: "The UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef) databases combine closely related sequences into a single record to speed searches. There are three different non-redundant databases with different sequence identity cut-offs. In UniRef100, UniRef90 and UniRef50 databases no pair of sequences in the representative set has &gt;100%, &gt;90% or &gt;50% mutual sequence identity. The three UniRef databases allow the user to choose between a fast search and a truly comprehensive one."
