<tr>
<td>-mode</td>
<td>This option specifies whether to remove redundancy at a single threshold percentage sequence similarity or remove redundancy outside a range of acceptable threshold percentage similarity. All permutations of pair-wise sequence alignments are calculated for each set of input sequences in turn using the EMBOSS implementation of the Needleman and Wunsch global alignment algorithm. Redundant sequences are removed in one of two modes as follows: (i) If a pair of proteins achieve greater than a threshold percentage sequence similarity (specified by the user) the shortest sequence is discarded. (ii) If a pair of proteins have a percentage sequence similarity that lies outside an acceptable range (specified by the user) the shortest sequence is discarded.</td>

<tr>
<td>-gapopen</td>
<td>The gap open penalty is the score taken away when a gap is created. The best value depends on the choice of comparison matrix. The default value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein sequences, and the EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide sequences.</td>
<td>Floating point number from 1.0 to 100.0</td>
<td>10.0 for any sequence</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>-gapextend</td>
<td>The gap extension, penalty is added to the standard gap penalty for each base or residue in the gap. This is how long gaps are penalized. Usually you will expect a few long gaps rather than many short gaps, so the gap extension penalty should be lower than the gap penalty. An exception is where one or both sequences are single reads with possible sequencing errors in which case you would expect many single base gaps. You can get this result by setting the gap open penalty to zero (or very low) and using the gap extension penalty to control gap scoring.</td>
