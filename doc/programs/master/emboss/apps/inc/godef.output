namespace: biological_process
def: The chemical reactions and pathways involving a cell wall arabinogalactan II glycoprotein, which is composed of a group of core protein of highly varying length and domain complexity. These are O-glycosylated at one or more hydroxyproline residues by arabinogalactan (AG) type II groups, which consist of (1-&gt;3)-beta-galactan and (1-&gt;6)-beta-linked galactan chains connected to each other by (1-&gt;3,1-&gt;6)-linked branch points, O-3 and O-6 positions substituted with terminal arabinosyl residues. Also, rhamnose, fucose, glucuronic and galacturonic acid can be present in the glycan structures.
