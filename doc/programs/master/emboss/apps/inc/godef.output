id: GO:0016011
name: dystroglycan complex
namespace: cellular_component
def: A protein complex that includes alpha- and beta-dystroglycan, which are alternative products of the same gene; the laminin-binding component of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex, providing a link between the subsarcolemmal cytoskeleton (in muscle cells) and the extracellular matrix. Alpha-dystroglycan is an extracellular protein binding to alpha-laminin and to beta-dystroglycan; beta-dystroglycan is a transmembrane protein which binds alpha-dystroglycan and dystrophin.

name: arabinogalactan protein metabolic process
namespace: biological_process
def: The chemical reactions and pathways involving a cell wall arabinogalactan II glycoprotein, which is composed of a group of core protein of highly varying length and domain complexity. These are O-glycosylated at one or more hydroxyproline residues by arabinogalactan (AG) type II groups, which consist of (1-&gt;3)-beta-galactan and (1-&gt;6)-beta-linked galactan chains connected to each other by (1-&gt;3,1-&gt;6)-linked branch points, O-3 and O-6 positions substituted with terminal arabinosyl residues. Also, rhamnose, fucose, glucuronic and galacturonic acid can be present in the glycan structures.
