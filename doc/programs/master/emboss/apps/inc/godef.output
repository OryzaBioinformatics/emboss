name: N-acetylglucosamine transmembrane transporter activity
namespace: molecular_function
def: Catalysis of the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from one side of the membrane to the other. The D isomer of N-acetylglucosamine is a common structural unit of glycoproteins in plants, bacteria and animals; it is often the terminal sugar of an oligosaccharide group of a glycoprotein.

name: dystroglycan binding
namespace: molecular_function
def: Interacting selectively and non-covalently with dystroglycan. Dystroglycan is glycoprotein found in non-muscle tissues as well as in muscle tissues, often in association with dystrophin. The native dystroglycan cleaved into two non-covalently associated subunits, alpha (N-terminal) and beta (C-terminal).

id: GO:0031150
name: sorocarp stalk development
namespace: biological_process
def: The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the sorocarp stalk over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The sorocarp stalk is a tubular structure that consists of cellulose-covered cells stacked on top of each other and surrounded by an acellular stalk tube composed of cellulose and glycoprotein. An example of this process is found in Dictyostelium discoideum.
