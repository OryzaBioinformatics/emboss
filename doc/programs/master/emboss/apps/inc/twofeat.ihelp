                                  sense that the two features must be on. This
                                  is ignored (always 'Any') when looking at
                                  protein sequence features. (Values: A (Any
                                  sense); S (Same sense); O (Opposite sense))
   -order              menu       [A] This allows you to specify the required
                                  order of the two features. The order is
                                  measured from the start positions of the
                                  features. This criterion is always applied
                                  despite the specified overlap type required.
                                  (Values: A (Any); AB (Feature A then
                                  feature B); BA (Feature B then feature A))
   -twoout             toggle     [N] If you set this to be true, then the two
                                  features themselves will be written out. If
                                  it is left as false, then a single feature
                                  will be written out covering the two
                                  features you found.
*  -typeout            string     [misc_feature] If you have specified that
                                  the pairs of features that are found should
                                  be reported as one feature in the ouput,
                                  then you can specify the 'type' name of the
                                  new feature here. By default every feature
                                  in the feature table is allowed. See
                                  http://www3.ebi.ac.uk/Services/WebFeat/ for
                                  a list of the EMBL feature types and see
                                  Appendix A of the Swissprot user manual in
                                  http://www.expasy.ch/txt/userman.txt for a
                                  list of the Swissprot feature types. If you
                                  specify an invalid feature type name, then
                                  the default name 'misc_feature' is used.
