<td>-atag</td>

For example in the EMBL feature table, a 'CDS' type of feature may have the tags '/codon', '/codon_start', '/db_xref', '/EC_number', '/evidence', '/exception', '/function', '/gene', '/label', '/map', '/note', '/number', '/partial', '/product', '/protein_id', '/pseudo', '/standard_name', '/translation', '/transl_except', '/transl_table', or '/usedin'. Some of these tags also have values, for example '/gene' can have the value of the gene name.
By default any feature tag in the feature table is allowed. You can set this to match any feature tag you wish to allow.
