                                  matrix names with a '@' character in front
                                  of it, for example,
                                  '@matrix.list'.

                                  character or '!' are ignored and all other
                                  lines are concatenated together with a comma
                                  character ',' and then treated as the list
                                  of enzymes to search
                                  for.
                                  An example of a file of matrix names is:
                                  ! my matrices
                                  ma0001, ma0002

                                  ma0010
                                  ma0032

                                  or equal to this percentage
                                  then a hit will be reported (Any numeric
                                  value)
