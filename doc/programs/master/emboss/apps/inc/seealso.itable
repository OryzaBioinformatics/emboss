<tr>
<td>-explode</td>
<td>The groups that EMBOSS applications belong to have two forms, exploded and not exploded. The exploded group names are more numerous and often vaguely phrased than the non-exploded ones. The exploded names are formed from definitions of the group names that start like NAME1:NAME2 and which are then expanded into many combinations of the names as: 'NAME1', 'NAME2', 'NAME1 NAME2', NAME2 NAME1'. The non-expanded names are simply like: 'NAME1 NAME2'.
Using expanded group names will find many more programs which share at least some of the expanded names than using the non-exploded names and so you will get more programs reported as sharing a similar function than you will if you specify that you wish to use non-exploded names</td>

To aid programs that parse the output of seealso that require the names of these subgroups, a colon ':' will be placed between the first and second level of the group name if this option is true.</td>
