The EMBOSS REBASE restriction enzyme data files are stored iin
directory 'data/REBASE/*' under the EMBOSS installation directory.

<p>

These files must first be set up using the program <a
href="rebaseextract.html">'<b>rebaseextract</b>'</a>.  Running
'rebaseextract' may be the job of your system manager.

<p>
      
The data files are stored in the REBASE directory of the standard EMBOSS
data directory. The names are:

<ul>
<li> embossre.enz     Cleavage information
<li> embossre.ref     Reference/methylation information
<li> embossre.sup     Supplier information
</ul>
	 
The column information is described at the top of the data files
	 
<p>
	 
The reported enzyme from any one group of isoschizomers (the prototype)
is specified in the REBASE database and the information is held in the
data file 'embossre.equ'.  You may edit this file to set your own
preferred prototype, if you wish. 
	 
<p>
	 
The format of the file "embossre.equ" is
<br>
Enzyme-name Prototype-name
	 
<p>
	 
i.e.  two columns of enzyme names separated by a space.  The first name
of the pair of enzymes is the name that is not preferred and the second
is the preferred (prototype) name.
