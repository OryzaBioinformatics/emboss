Find EDAM ontology terms by has_input relation
Version: EMBOSS:6.4.0.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-identifier]        string     Identifier(s) to search for in ontology (Any
                                  string)
  [-outfile]           outobo     [*.edamhasinput] Output ontology term file
                                  name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -namespace          menu       [*] By default all terms are returned.
                                  Searches can be limited to one or a few
                                  namespaces. (Values: data (Data entity);
                                  entity (Biological entity); format (Data
                                  format); identifier (Identifier); operation
                                  (Bioinformatics operation); resource (Data
                                  resource); topic (Field of bioinformatics
                                  study))

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -sensitive          boolean    [N] By default, the query keywords are
                                  matched against the EDAM term names (and
                                  synonyms) only. This option also matches the
                                  keywords against the EDAM term definitions
                                  and will therefore (typically) report more
                                  matches.
   -subclasses         boolean    [N] Extend the query matches to include all
                                  terms which are specialisations (EDAM
                                  sub-classes) of the matched type.
   -obsolete           boolean    [N] The default behaviour is to not use or
                                  return obsolete terms. This option if set
                                  will include all terms.
