Identify proteins with specified sequence word composition
Version: EMBOSS:6.3.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-sequence]          seqall     Protein sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
  [-infile]            infile     This is a file in the format of the output
                                  produced by 'compseq' that is used to set
                                  the minimum frequencies of words in this
                                  analysis.
*  -window             integer    [30] This is the size of window in which to
                                  count.
                                  Thus if you want to count frequencies in a
                                  40 aa stretch you should enter 40 here.
                                  (Integer 10 or more)
  [-outfile]           outfile    [*.oddcomp] This is the results file.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -fullwindow         toggle     [N] Set this option on (Y) if you want the
                                  window size to be set to the length of the
                                  current protein. Otherwise, leave this
                                  option unset, in which case you'll be
                                  prompted for a window size to use.
   -[no]ignorebz       boolean    [Y] The amino acid code B represents
                                  Asparagine or Aspartic acid and the code Z
                                  represents Glutamine or Glutamic acid.
                                  These are not commonly used codes and you
                                  may wish not to count words containing them,
                                  just noting them in the count of 'Other'
                                  words.
