   -minsize            integer    [30] Minimum nucleotide size of ORF to
                                  report (Any integer value)
   -maxsize            integer    [1000000] Maximum nucleotide size of ORF to
                                  report (Any integer value)
   -find               menu       [0] This is a small menu of possible output
                                  options. The first four options are to
                                  select either the protein translation or the
                                  original nucleic acid sequence of the open
                                  reading frame. There are two possible
                                  definitions of an open reading frame: it can
                                  either be a region that is free of STOP
                                  codons or a region that begins with a START
                                  codon and ends with a STOP codon. The last
                                  three options are probably only of interest
                                  to people who wish to investigate the
                                  statistical properties of the regions around
                                  potential START or STOP codons. The last
                                  option assumes that ORF lengths are
                                  calculated between two STOP codons. (Values:
                                  0 (Translation of regions between STOP
                                  codons); 1 (Translation of regions between
                                  START and STOP codons); 2 (Nucleic sequences
                                  between STOP codons); 3 (Nucleic sequences
                                  between START and STOP codons); 4
                                  (Nucleotides flanking START codons); 5
                                  (Nucleotides flanking initial STOP codons);
                                  6 (Nucleotides flanking ending STOP codons))

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -[no]methionine     boolean    [Y] START codons at the beginning of protein
                                  products will usually code for Methionine,
                                  despite what the codon will code for when it
                                  is internal to a protein. This qualifier
                                  sets all such START codons to code for
                                  Methionine by default.
   -circular           boolean    [N] Is the sequence circular
   -[no]reverse        boolean    [Y] Set this to be false if you do not wish
                                  to find ORFs in the reverse complement of
                                  the sequence.
   -flanking           integer    [100] If you have chosen one of the options
                                  of the type of sequence to find that gives
                                  the flanking sequence around a STOP or START
                                  codon, this allows you to set the number of
                                  nucleotides either side of that codon to
                                  output. If the region of flanking
                                  nucleotides crosses the start or end of the
                                  sequence, no output is given for this codon.
