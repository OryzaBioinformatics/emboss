Find public databases by format
Version: EMBOSS:6.4.0.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-query]             string     List of EDAM data keywords (Any string)
  [-outfile]           outresource [*.drfindformat] Output data resource file
                                  name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -sensitive          boolean    [N] By default, the query keywords are
                                  matched against the EDAM term names (and
                                  synonyms) only. This option also matches the
                                  keywords against the EDAM term definitions
                                  and will therefore (typically) report more
                                  matches.
   -[no]subclasses     boolean    [Y] Extend the query matches to include all
                                  terms which are specialisations (EDAM
                                  sub-classes) of the matched type.
