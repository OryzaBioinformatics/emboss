                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of
                                  pairs of positions.
                                  The positions are integers.

                                  formatting for HTML.
                                  If this is left blank, then the sequence is
                                  left alone.
                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of
                                  pairs of positions.
                                  The positions are integers.

                                  A file of ranges to colour (one range per
                                  line) can be specified as '@filename'.
   -annotation         range      [If this is left blank, then no annotation
                                  is added.] Regions to annotate by marking.
                                  If this is left blank, then no annotation is
                                  added.
                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of
                                  pairs of positions followed by optional
                                  text.
                                  The positions are integers.
                                  They are followed by any text (but not
                                  digits when on the command-line).
                                  Examples of region specifications are:
                                  24-45 new domain 56-78 match to Mouse
                                  1-100 First part 120-156 oligo
                                  A file of ranges to annotate (one range per
                                  line) can be specified as '@filename'.
   -enzymes            string     [all] The name 'all' reads in all enzyme
                                  names from the REBASE database. You can
                                  specify enzymes by giving their names with
                                  commas between then, such as:
                                  'HincII,hinfI,ppiI,hindiii'.
                                  The case of the names is not important. You
                                  can specify a file of enzyme names to read
                                  in by giving the name of the file holding
                                  the enzyme names with a '@' character in
                                  front of it, for example, '@enz.list'.
                                  Blank lines and lines starting with a hash
                                  character or '!' are ignored and all other
                                  lines are concatenated together with a comma
                                  character ',' and then treated as the list
                                  of enzymes to search for.
                                  An example of a file of enzyme names is:
                                  ! my enzymes
                                  HincII, ppiII

   -sourcematch        string     [*] By default any feature source in the
                                  feature table is shown. You can set this to
                                  match any feature source you wish to show.
                                  The source name is usually either the name
                                  of the program that detected the feature or
                                  it is the feature table (eg: EMBL) that the
                                  feature came from.
                                  The source may be wildcarded by using '*'.
                                  If you wish to show more than one source,

   -typematch          string     [*] By default any feature type in the
                                  feature table is shown. You can set this to
                                  match any feature type you wish to show.
                                  See http://www3.ebi.ac.uk/Services/WebFeat/
                                  for a list of the EMBL feature types and see
                                  Appendix A of the Swissprot user manual in

                                  in the feature table is shown. You can set
                                  this to match any feature sense you wish to
                                  show. 0 - any sense, 1 - forward sense, -1 -

                                  default), then any score is ignored (Any
                                  numeric value)
   -tagmatch           string     [*] Tags are the types of extra values that
                                  a feature may have. For example in the EMBL
                                  feature table, a 'CDS' type of feature may
                                  have the tags '/codon', '/codon_start',
                                  '/db_xref', '/EC_number', '/evidence',
                                  '/exception', '/function', '/gene',
                                  '/label', '/map', '/note', '/number',
                                  '/partial', '/product', '/protein_id',
                                  '/pseudo', '/standard_name', '/translation',
                                  '/transl_except', '/transl_table', or
                                  '/usedin'. Some of these tags also have
                                  values, for example '/gene' can have the
                                  value of the gene name.
                                  By default any feature tag in the feature
                                  table is shown. You can set this to match
                                  any feature tag you wish to show.
                                  The tag may be wildcarded by using '*'.
                                  If you wish to show more than one tag,
                                  separate their names with the character '|',
                                  eg:
                                  gene | label (Any string)
   -valuematch         string     [*] Tag values are the values associated
                                  with a feature tag. Tags are the types of
                                  extra values that a feature may have. For
                                  example in the EMBL feature table, a 'CDS'
                                  type of feature may have the tags '/codon',
                                  '/codon_start', '/db_xref', '/EC_number',
                                  '/evidence', '/exception', '/function',
                                  '/gene', '/label', '/map', '/note',
                                  '/number', '/partial', '/product',
                                  '/protein_id', '/pseudo', '/standard_name',
                                  '/translation', '/transl_except',
                                  '/transl_table', or '/usedin'. Only some of
                                  these tags can have values, for example
                                  '/gene' can have the value of the gene name.
                                  By default any feature tag value in the
                                  feature table is shown. You can set this to
                                  match any feature tag valueyou wish to show.
                                  The tag value may be wildcarded by using
                                  '*'.
                                  If you wish to show more than one tag value,
                                  separate their names with the character
                                  '|', eg:
                                  pax* | 10 (Any string)
   -stricttags         boolean    [N] By default if any tag/value pair in a
                                  feature matches the specified tag and value,
                                  then all the tags/value pairs of that
                                  feature will be displayed. If this is set to
                                  be true, then only those tag/value pairs in
                                  a feature that match the specified tag and
                                  value will be displayed.

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:

                                  methylation data file (optional)
   -flatreformat       boolean    [N] This changes the output format to one

                                  row of '===' characters and the cut site is
                                  pointed to by a '>' character in the
                                  forward sense, or a '<' in the reverse sense
                                  strand.
   -mincuts            integer    [1] This sets the minimum number of cuts for
                                  any restriction enzyme that will be
                                  considered. Any enzymes that cut fewer times
                                  than this will be ignored. (Integer from 1
                                  to 1000)
   -maxcuts            integer    [2000000000] This sets the maximum number of
                                  cuts for any restriction enzyme that will
                                  be considered. Any enzymes that cut more
                                  times than this will be ignored. (Integer up
                                  to 2000000000)
   -sitelen            integer    [4] This sets the minimum length of the
                                  restriction enzyme recognition site. Any
                                  enzymes with sites shorter than this will be
                                  ignored. (Integer from 2 to 20)
   -single             boolean    [N] If this is set then this forces the
                                  values of the mincuts and maxcuts qualifiers
                                  to both be 1. Any other value you may have
                                  set them to will be ignored.
   -[no]blunt          boolean    [Y] This allows those enzymes which cut at
                                  the same position on the forward and reverse
                                  strands to be considered.
   -[no]sticky         boolean    [Y] This allows those enzymes which cut at
                                  different positions on the forward and
                                  reverse strands, leaving an overhang, to be
                                  considered.
   -[no]ambiguity      boolean    [Y] This allows those enzymes which have one
                                  or more 'N' ambiguity codes in their
                                  pattern to be considered
   -plasmid            boolean    [N] If this is set then this allows searches
                                  for restriction enzyme recognition site and
                                  cut postions that span the end of the
                                  sequence to be considered.
   -methylation        boolean    [N] If this is set then RE recognition sites
                                  will not match methylated bases.
   -[no]commercial     boolean    [Y] If this is set, then only those enzymes
                                  with a commercial supplier will be searched
                                  for. This qualifier is ignored if you have
                                  specified an explicit list of enzymes to
                                  search for, rather than searching through
                                  'all' the enzymes in the REBASE database. It
                                  is assumed that, if you are asking for an
                                  explicit enzyme, then you probably know
                                  where to get it from and so all enzymes
                                  names that you have asked to be searched
                                  for, and which cut, will be reported whether
                                  or not they have a commercial supplier.
   -[no]limit          boolean    [Y] This limits the reporting of enzymes to
                                  just one enzyme from each group of
                                  isoschizomers. The enzyme chosen to
                                  represent an isoschizomer group is the
                                  prototype indicated in the data file
                                  'embossre.equ', which is created by the
                                  program 'rebaseextract'. If you prefer
                                  different prototypes to be used, make a copy
                                  of embossre.equ in your home directory and
                                  edit it. If this value is set to be false
                                  then all of the input enzymes will be
                                  reported. You might like to set this to
                                  false if you are supplying an explicit set
                                  of enzymes rather than searching 'all' of
                                  them.
   -orfminsize         integer    [0] This sets the minimum size of Open
                                  Reading Frames (ORFs) to display in the
                                  translations. All other translation regions
                                  are masked by changing the amino acids to

   -margin             integer    [10] Margin around sequence for numbering
                                  (Integer 0 or more)
   -[no]name           boolean    [Y] Set this to be false if you do not wish
                                  to display the ID name of the sequence
   -[no]description    boolean    [Y] Set this to be false if you do not wish
                                  to display the description of the sequence
   -offset             integer    [1] Offset to start numbering the sequence
                                  from (Any integer value)
   -html               boolean    [N] Use HTML formatting
