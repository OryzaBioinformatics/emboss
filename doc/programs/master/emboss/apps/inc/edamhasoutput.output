name: Genetic variation analysis
namespace: operation
def: Analyse a genetic variation, for example to annotate its location, alleles, classification, and effects on individual transcripts predicted for a gene model.
comment: Genetic variation annotation provides contextual interpretation of coding SNP consequences in transcripts. It allows comparisons to be made between variation data in different populations or strains for the same transcript.

name: Sequence assembly
namespace: operation
def: Combine (align and merge) overlapping fragments of a DNA sequence to reconstruct the original sequence.
comment: For example, assemble overlapping reads from paired-end sequencers into contigs (a contiguous sequence corresponding to read overlaps). Or assemble contigs, for example ESTs and genomic DNA fragments, depending on the detected fragment overlaps.
