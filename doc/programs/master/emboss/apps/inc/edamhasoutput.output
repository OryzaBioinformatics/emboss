name: Sequence retrieval
namespace: operation
def: Query a sequence data resource (typically a database) and retrieve sequences and / or annotation.
comment: This includes direct retrieval methods (e.g. the dbfetch program) but not those that perform calculations on the sequence.

id: EDAM_operation:2871
name: Sequence tagged site (STS) mapping
namespace: operation
def: Generate a physical DNA map (sequence map) from analysis of sequence tagged sites (STS).
comment: An STS is a short subsequence of known sequence and location that occurs only once in the chromosome or genome that is being mapped. Sources of STSs include 1. expressed sequence tags (ESTs), simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLPs), and random genomic sequences from cloned genomic DNA or database sequences.

[Term]
id: EDAM_operation:0310
name: Sequence assembly
namespace: operation
def: Combine (align and merge) overlapping fragments of a DNA sequence to reconstruct the original sequence.
comment: For example, assemble overlapping reads from paired-end sequencers into contigs (a contiguous sequence corresponding to read overlaps). Or assemble contigs, for example ESTs and genomic DNA fragments, depending on the detected fragment overlaps.
