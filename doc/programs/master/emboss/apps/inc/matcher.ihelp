   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-asequence]         sequence   Sequence filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input USA)
  [-bsequence]         sequence   Sequence filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input USA)
  [-outfile]           align      Output alignment file name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -datafile           matrix     [EBLOSUM62 for protein, EDNAFULL for DNA]
                                  This is the scoring matrix file used when
                                  comparing sequences. By default it is the
                                  file 'EBLOSUM62' (for proteins) or the file
                                  'EDNAFULL' (for nucleic sequences). These
                                  files are found in the 'data' directory of
                                  the EMBOSS installation.
   -alternatives       integer    [1] This sets the number of alternative
                                  matches output. By default only the highest
                                  scoring alignment is shown. A value of 2
                                  gves you other reasonable alignments. In
                                  some cases, for example multidomain proteins
                                  of cDNA and gemomic DNA comparisons, there
                                  may be other interesting and significant
                                  alignments. (Integer 1 or more)
   -gapopen            integer    [14 for protein, 16 for nucleic] The gap
                                  penalty is the score taken away when a gap
                                  is created. The best value depends on the
                                  choice of comparison matrix. The default
                                  value of 14 assumes you are using the
                                  EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein sequences, or a
                                  value of 16 and the EDNAFULL matrix for
                                  nucleotide sequences. (Positive integer)
   -gapextend          integer    [4 for any sequence] The gap length, or gap
                                  extension, penalty is added to the standard
                                  gap penalty for each base or residue in the
                                  gap. This is how long gaps are penalized.
                                  Usually you will expect a few long gaps
                                  rather than many short gaps, so the gap
                                  extension penalty should be lower than the
                                  gap penalty. An exception is where one or
                                  both sequences are single reads with
                                  possible sequencing errors in which case you
                                  would expect many single base gaps. You can
                                  get this result by setting the gap penalty
                                  to zero (or very low) and using the gap
                                  extension penalty to control gap scoring.
                                  (Positive integer)
