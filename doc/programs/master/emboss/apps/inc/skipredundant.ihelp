Remove redundant sequences from an input set
Version: EMBOSS:6.2.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-sequences]         seqset     Sequence set filename and optional format,
                                  or reference (input USA)
   -mode               menu       [1] This option specifies whether to remove
                                  redundancy at a single threshold percentage
                                  sequence similarity or remove redundancy
                                  outside a range of acceptable threshold
                                  percentage similarity. All permutations of
                                  pair-wise sequence alignments are calculated
                                  for each set of input sequences in turn
                                  using the EMBOSS implementation of the
                                  Needleman and Wunsch global alignment
                                  algorithm. Redundant sequences are removed
                                  in one of two modes as follows: (i) If a
                                  pair of proteins achieve greater than a
                                  threshold percentage sequence similarity
                                  (specified by the user) the shortest
                                  sequence is discarded. (ii) If a pair of
                                  proteins have a percentage sequence
                                  similarity that lies outside an acceptable
                                  range (specified by the user) the shortest
                                  sequence is discarded. (Values: 1 (Single
                                  threshold percentage sequence similarity); 2
                                  (Outside a range of acceptable threshold
                                  percentage similarities))
*  -threshold          float      [95.0] This option specifies the percentage
                                  sequence identity redundancy threshold. The
                                  percentage sequence identity redundancy
                                  threshold determines the redundancy
                                  calculation. If a pair of proteins achieve
                                  greater than this threshold the shortest
                                  sequence is discarded. (Any numeric value)
*  -minthreshold       float      [30.0] This option specifies the percentage
                                  sequence identity redundancy threshold
                                  (lower limit). The percentage sequence
                                  identity redundancy threshold determines the
                                  redundancy calculation. If a pair of
                                  proteins have a percentage sequence
                                  similarity that lies outside an acceptable
                                  range the shortest sequence is discarded.
                                  (Any numeric value)
*  -maxthreshold       float      [90.0] This option specifies the percentage
                                  sequence identity redundancy threshold
                                  (upper limit). The percentage sequence
                                  identity redundancy threshold determines the
                                  redundancy calculation. If a pair of
                                  proteins have a percentage sequence
                                  similarity that lies outside an acceptable
                                  range the shortest sequence is discarded.
                                  (Any numeric value)
   -gapopen            float      [10.0 for any sequence] The gap open penalty
                                  is the score taken away when a gap is
                                  created. The best value depends on the
                                  choice of comparison matrix. The default
                                  value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62
                                  matrix for protein sequences, and the
                                  EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide sequences.
                                  (Floating point number from 1.0 to 100.0)
   -gapextend          float      [0.5 for any sequence] The gap extension,
                                  penalty is added to the standard gap penalty
                                  for each base or residue in the gap. This
                                  is how long gaps are penalized. Usually you
                                  will expect a few long gaps rather than many
                                  short gaps, so the gap extension penalty
                                  should be lower than the gap penalty. An
                                  exception is where one or both sequences are
                                  single reads with possible sequencing
                                  errors in which case you would expect many
                                  single base gaps. You can get this result by
                                  setting the gap open penalty to zero (or
                                  very low) and using the gap extension
                                  penalty to control gap scoring. (Floating
                                  point number from 0.0 to 10.0)
  [-outseq]            seqoutall  [<sequence>.<format>] Sequence set(s)

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -datafile           matrixf    [EBLOSUM62 for protein, EDNAFULL for DNA]
                                  This is the scoring matrix file used when
                                  comparing sequences. By default it is the
                                  file 'EBLOSUM62' (for proteins) or the file
                                  'EDNAFULL' (for nucleic sequences). These
                                  files are found in the 'data' directory of
                                  the EMBOSS installation.
