   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence(s) filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input USA)
  [-outseq]            seqout     [<sequence>.<format>] Sequence filename and
                                  optional format (output USA)

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -type               string     [repeat*] By default any feature in the
                                  feature table with a type starting 'repeat'
                                  is masked. You can set this to be any
                                  feature type you wish to mask.
                                  See http://www3.ebi.ac.uk/Services/WebFeat/
                                  for a list of the EMBL feature types and see
                                  Appendix A of the Swissprot user manual in
                                  http://www.expasy.ch/txt/userman.txt for a
                                  list of the Swissprot feature types.
                                  The type may be wildcarded by using '*'.
                                  If you wish to mask more than one type,
                                  separate their names with spaces or commas,
                                  eg:
                                  *UTR repeat* (Any string is accepted)
   -tolower            toggle     [N] The region can be 'masked' by converting
                                  the sequence characters to lower-case, some
                                  non-EMBOSS programs e.g. fasta can
                                  interpret this as a masked region. The
                                  sequence is unchanged apart from the case
                                  change. You might like to ensure that the
                                  whole sequence is in upper-case before
                                  masking the specified regions to lower-case
                                  by using the '-supper' flag.
*  -maskchar           string     ['X' for protein, 'N' for nucleic] Character
                                  to use when masking.
                                  Default is 'X' for protein sequences, 'N'
                                  for nucleic sequences.
                                  If the mask character is set to be the SPACE
                                  character or a null character, then the
                                  sequence is 'masked' by changing it to
                                  lower-case, just as with the '-lowercase'
                                  flag. (Any string up to 1 characters)
