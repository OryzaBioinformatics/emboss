  [-sequence]          seqall     Protein sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
   -pattern            pattern    The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the
                                  amino acids are used.
                                  The symbol 'x' is used for a position where
                                  any amino acid is accepted.
                                  Ambiguities are indicated by listing the
                                  acceptable amino acids for a given position,
                                  between square parentheses '[ ]'. For
                                  example: [ALT] stands for Ala or Leu or Thr.
                                  Ambiguities are also indicated by listing
                                  between a pair of curly brackets '{ }' the
                                  amino acids that are not accepted at a given
                                  position. For example: {AM} stands for any
                                  amino acid except Ala and Met.
                                  Each element in a pattern is separated from
                                  its neighbor by a '-'. (Optional in
                                  fuzzpro).
                                  Repetition of an element of the pattern can
                                  be indicated by following that element with
                                  a numerical value or a numerical range
                                  between parenthesis. Examples: x(3)
                                  corresponds to x-x-x, x(2,4) corresponds to
                                  x-x or x-x-x or x-x-x-x.
                                  When a pattern is restricted to either the
                                  N- or C-terminal of a sequence, that pattern
                                  either starts with a '<' symbol or
                                  respectively ends with a '>' symbol.
                                  A period ends the pattern. (Optional in
                                  fuzzpro).
                                  For example, [DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C
