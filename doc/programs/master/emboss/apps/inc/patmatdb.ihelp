Searches protein sequences with a sequence motif
Version: EMBOSS:6.2.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Protein sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
  [-motif]             string     Patterns for patmatdb are based on the
                                  format of pattern used in the PROSITE
                                  database. For example:
                                  '[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C' means two Asps or
                                  Glus in any order followed by His, Ser, any
                                  residue other then Pro, then two of any
                                  residue followed by Pro followed by two to
                                  four of any residue followed by Cys. The
                                  search is case-independent, so 'AAA' matches
                                  'aaa'. (Any string of at least 2
                                  characters)
  [-outfile]           report     [*.patmatdb] Output report file name
