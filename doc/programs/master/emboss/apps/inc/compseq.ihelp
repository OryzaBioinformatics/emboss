Calculate the composition of unique words in sequences
Version: EMBOSS:6.3.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence(s) filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input USA)
   -word               integer    [2] This is the size of word (n-mer) to
                                  count.
                                  Thus if you want to count codon frequencies
                                  for a nucleotide sequence, you should enter
                                  3 here. (Integer 1 or more)
  [-outfile]           outfile    [*.compseq] This is the results file.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -infile             infile     This is a file previously produced by
                                  'compseq' that can be used to set the
                                  expected frequencies of words in this
                                  analysis.
                                  The word size in the current run must be the
                                  same as the one in this results file.
                                  Obviously, you should use a file produced
                                  from protein sequences if you are counting
                                  protein sequence word frequencies, and you
                                  must use one made from nucleotide
                                  frequencies if you are analysing a
                                  nucleotide sequence.
   -frame              integer    [0] The normal behaviour of 'compseq' is to
                                  count the frequencies of all words that
                                  occur by moving a window of length 'word' up
                                  by one each time.
                                  This option allows you to move the window up
                                  by the length of the word each time,
                                  skipping over the intervening words.
                                  You can count only those words that occur in
                                  a single frame of the word by setting this
                                  value to a number other than zero.
                                  If you set it to 1 it will only count the
                                  words in frame 1, 2 will only count the
                                  words in frame 2 and so on. (Integer 0 or
                                  more)
*  -[no]ignorebz       boolean    [Y] The amino acid code B represents
                                  Asparagine or Aspartic acid and the code Z
                                  represents Glutamine or Glutamic acid.
                                  These are not commonly used codes and you
                                  may wish not to count words containing them,
                                  just noting them in the count of 'Other'
                                  words.
*  -reverse            boolean    [N] Set this to be true if you also wish to
                                  also count words in the reverse complement
                                  of a nucleic sequence.
   -calcfreq           boolean    [N] If this is set true then the expected
                                  frequencies of words are calculated from the
                                  observed frequency of single bases or
                                  residues in the sequences.
                                  If you are reporting a word size of 1
                                  (single bases or residues) then there is no
                                  point in using this option because the
                                  calculated expected frequency will be equal
                                  to the observed frequency.
                                  Calculating the expected frequencies like
                                  this will give an approximation of the
                                  expected frequencies that you might get by
                                  using an input file of frequencies produced
                                  by a previous run of this program. If an
                                  input file of expected word frequencies has
                                  been specified then the values from that
                                  file will be used instead of this
                                  calculation of expected frequency from the
                                  sequence, even if 'calcfreq' is set to be
                                  true.
   -[no]zerocount      boolean    [Y] You can make the output results file
                                  much smaller if you do not display the words
                                  with a zero count.
