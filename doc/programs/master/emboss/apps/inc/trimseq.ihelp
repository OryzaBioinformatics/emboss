Remove unwanted characters from start and end of sequence(s)
Version: EMBOSS:6.2.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     (Gapped) sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
  [-outseq]            seqoutall  [<sequence>.<format>] Sequence set(s)
                                  filename and optional format (output USA)

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -window             integer    [1] This determines the size of the region
                                  that is considered when deciding whether the
                                  percentage of ambiguity is greater than the
                                  threshold. A value of 5 means that a region
                                  of 5 letters in the sequence is shifted
                                  along the sequence from the ends and
                                  trimming is done only if there is a greater
                                  or equal percentage of ambiguity than the
                                  threshold percentage. (Any integer value)
   -percent            float      [100.0] This is the threshold of the
                                  percentage ambiguity in the window required
                                  in order to trim a sequence. (Any numeric
                                  value)
   -strict             boolean    [N] In nucleic sequences, trim off not only
                                  N's and X's, but also the nucleotide IUPAC
                                  ambiguity codes M, R, W, S, Y, K, V, H, D
                                  and B. In protein sequences, trim off not
                                  only X's but also B and Z.
   -star               boolean    [N] In protein sequences, trim off not only
                                  X's, but also the *'s

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -[no]left           boolean    [Y] Trim at the start
   -[no]right          boolean    [Y] Trim at the end
