ID      CuticleDB
Name    Structural proteins of the arthropod cuticle (CuticleDB)
Desc    A relational database containing all structural proteins of Arthropod cuticle identified to date. Many come from direct sequencing of proteins isolated from cuticle and from sequences from cDNAs that share common features with these authentic cuticular proteins. It also includes proteins from the Drosophila melanogaster and the Anopheles gambiae genomes, that have been predicted to be cuticular proteins, based on a Pfam motif responsible for chitin binding in Arthropod cuticle.

ID      PIRSF
Acc     DB-0079
Name    PIRSF whole-protein classification database
Desc    Non-overlapping clustering of UniProtKB sequences into a hierarchical order to reflect their evolutionary relationships. The PIRSF classification system is based on whole proteins rather than on the component domains therefore, it allows annotation of generic biochemical and specific biological functions, as well as classification of proteins without well-defined domains.

ID      SCOP
Name    Structural classification of proteins (SCOP) database
Desc    The SCOP database, created by manual inspection and abetted by a battery of automated methods, aims to provide a detailed and comprehensive description of the structural and evolutionary relationships between all proteins whose structure is known. As such, it provides a broad survey of all known protein folds, detailed information about the close relatives of any particular protein, and a framework for future research and classification.
