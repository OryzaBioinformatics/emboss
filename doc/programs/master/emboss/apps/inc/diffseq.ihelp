   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-asequence]         sequence   Sequence filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input USA)
  [-bsequence]         sequence   Sequence filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input USA)
   -wordsize           integer    [10] The similar regions between the two
                                  sequences are found by creating a hash table
                                  of 'wordsize'd subsequences. 10 is a
                                  reasonable default. Making this value larger
                                  (20?) may speed up the program slightly,
                                  but will mean that any two differences
                                  within 'wordsize' of each other will be
                                  grouped as a single region of difference.
                                  This value may be made smaller (4?) to
                                  improve the resolution of nearby
                                  differences, but the program will go much
                                  slower. (Integer 2 or more)
  [-outfile]           report     [*.diffseq] Output report file name
  [-aoutfeat]          featout    [$(asequence.name).diffgff] File for output
                                  of first sequence's features
  [-boutfeat]          featout    [$(bsequence.name).diffgff] File for output
                                  of second sequence's features

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -globaldifferences  boolean    [N] Normally this program will find regions
                                  of identity that are the length of the
                                  specified word-size or greater and will then
                                  report the regions of difference between
                                  these matching regions. This works well and
                                  is what most people want if they are working
                                  with long overlapping nucleic acid
                                  sequences. You are usually not interested in
                                  the non-overlapping ends of these
                                  sequences. If you have protein sequences or
                                  short RNA sequences however, you will be
                                  interested in differences at the very ends .
                                  It this option is set to be true then the
                                  differences at the ends will also be
                                  reported.
