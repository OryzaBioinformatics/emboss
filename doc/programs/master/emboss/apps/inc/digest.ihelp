                                  format, or reference (input USA)
   -menu               menu       [1] Select number (Values: 1 (Trypsin); 2
                                  (Lys-C); 3 (Arg-C); 4 (Asp-N); 5

   -mono               boolean    [N] Use monoisotopic weights
  [-outfile]           report     [*.digest] Output report file name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -mwdata             datafile   [Emolwt.dat] Molecular weight data for amino
                                  acids
   -unfavoured         boolean    Trypsin will not normally cut after 'KR' if
                                  they are followed by any of 'KRIFLP'. Lys-C
                                  will not normally cut after 'K' if it is
                                  followed by 'P'. Arg-C will not normally cut
                                  after 'R' if it is followed by 'P'.
                                  V8-bicarb will not normally cut after 'E' if
                                  it is followed by any of 'KREP'. V8-phosph
                                  will not normally cut after 'DE' if they are
                                  followed by 'P'. Chymotrypsin will not
                                  normally cut after 'FYWLM' if they are
                                  followed by 'P'. Specifying unfavoured shows
                                  these unfavoured cuts as well as the
                                  favoured ones.
   -ragging            boolean    Allows semi-specific and non-specific
                                  digestion. This option is particularly
                                  useful for generating lists of peptide
                                  sequences for protein identification using
                                  mass-spectrometry.
   -termini            menu       [1] Select number (Values: 1 (none); 2
                                  (nterm); 3 (cterm); 4 (nterm OR cterm))
   -overlap            boolean    Used for partial digestion. Shows all cuts
                                  from favoured cut sites plus 1..3, 2..4,
                                  3..5 etc but not (e.g.) 2..5. Overlaps are
                                  therefore fragments with exactly one
                                  potential cut site within it.
   -allpartials        boolean    As for overlap but fragments containing more
                                  than one potential cut site are included.
