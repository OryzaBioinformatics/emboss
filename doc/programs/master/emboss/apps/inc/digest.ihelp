   -unfavoured         boolean    Trypsin will not normally cut after a K if
                                  it is followed by (e.g.) another K or a P.
                                  Specifying this shows those cuts. as well as
                                  the favoured ones.
   -ragging            boolean    Allows semi-specific and non-specific
                                  digestion. This option is particularly
                                  useful for generating lists of peptide
                                  sequences for protein identification using
                                  mass-spectrometry.
   -termini            menu       [1] Select number (Values: 1 (none); 2

   -overlap            boolean    Used for partial digestion. Shows all cuts
                                  from favoured cut sites plus 1..3, 2..4,
                                  3..5 etc but not (e.g.) 2..5. Overlaps are
                                  therefore fragments with exactly one
                                  potential cut site within it.
   -allpartials        boolean    As for overlap but fragments containing more
                                  than one potential cut site are included.
