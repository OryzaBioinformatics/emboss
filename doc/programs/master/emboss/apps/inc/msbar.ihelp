                                  These are only done if the sequence is
                                  nucleic. (Values: 0 (None); 1 (Any of the
                                  following); 2 (Insertions); 3 (Deletions); 4

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
*  -inframe            boolean    [N] Do 'codon' and 'block' operations in
                                  frame

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -othersequence      seqall     [asis:N] If you require that the resulting
                                  mutated sequence should not match a set of
                                  other sequences, then you can specify that
                                  set of sequences here. For example, if you
                                  require that the mutated sequence should not
                                  be the same as the input sequence, enter
                                  the input sequence here. If you want the
                                  result to be different to previous results
                                  of this program, specify the previous result
                                  sequences here. The program will check that
                                  the result does not match the sequences
                                  specified here before writing it out. If a
                                  match is found, then the mutation is started
                                  again with a fresh copy of the input
                                  sequence. If, after 10 such retries, there
                                  is still a match to the set of sequence
                                  given here, then the matching mutated
                                  sequence is written with a warning message.
   -minimum            integer    [1] Minimum size for a block mutation
                                  (Integer 0 or more)
   -maximum            integer    [10] Maximum size for a block mutation (Any
                                  integer value)
