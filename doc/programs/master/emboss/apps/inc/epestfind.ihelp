   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          sequence   Protein sequence USA to be analysed.

                                  charged amino acids. (Integer 2 or more)
   -order              selection  [score] Name of the output file which holds
                                  the results of the analysis. Results may be
                                  sorted by length, position and score.
  [-outfile]           outfile    [*.epestfind] Name of file to which results
                                  will be written.

                                  (ps, hpgl, hp7470, hp7580, meta, cps, x11,
                                  tekt, tek, none, data, xterm, png, gif)

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -aadata             datafile   [Eamino.dat] Amino acids properties and
                                  molecular weight data file
   -threshold          float      [+5.0] Threshold value to discriminate weak
                                  from potential PEST motifs. Valid PEST
                                  motifs are discriminated into 'poor' and
                                  'potential' motifs depending on this
                                  threshold score. By default, the default
                                  value is set to +5.0 based on experimental
                                  data. Alterations are not recommended since
                                  significance is a matter of biology, not
                                  mathematics. (Number from -55.00 to 55.00)

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:

                                  should be printed.
   -[no]poor           boolean    [Y] Decide whether poor PEST motifs should
                                  be printed.
   -invalid            boolean    [N] Decide whether invalid PEST motifs
                                  should be printed.
   -[no]map            boolean    [Y] Decide whether PEST motifs should be
                                  mapped to sequence.
