                                  match any feature source you wish to show.
                                  The source name is usually either the name
                                  of the program that detected the feature or
                                  it is the feature table (eg: EMBL) that the
                                  feature came from.
                                  The source may be wildcarded by using '*'.
                                  If you wish to show more than one source,
                                  separate their names with the character '|',
                                  eg:

                                  The type may be wildcarded by using '*'.
                                  If you wish to show more than one type,
                                  separate their names with the character '|',
                                  eg:

                                  If both minscore and maxscore are zero (the
                                  default), then any score is ignored (Any

   -tagmatch           string     [*] Tags are the types of extra values that
                                  a feature may have. By default any feature
                                  tag in the feature table is shown. You can
                                  set this to match any feature tag you wish
                                  to show.
                                  The tag may be wildcarded by using '*'.
                                  If you wish to show more than one tag,
                                  separate their names with the character '|',
                                  eg:

   -valuematch         string     [*] Tag values are the values associated
                                  with a feature tag. Tags are the types of
                                  extra values that a feature may have. By
                                  default any feature tag value in the feature
                                  table is shown. You can set this to match
                                  any feature tag valueyou wish to show.
                                  The tag value may be wildcarded by using
                                  '*'.
                                  If you wish to show more than one tag value,
                                  separate their names with the character
                                  '|', eg:
                                  pax* | 10 (Any string is accepted)
   -stricttags         boolean    [N] By default if any tag/value pair in a
                                  feature matches the specified tag and value,
                                  then all the tags/value pairs of that
                                  feature will be displayed. If this is set to
                                  be true, then only those tag/value pairs in
                                  a feature that match the specified tag and
                                  value will be displayed.
