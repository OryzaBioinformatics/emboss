<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>infoalign</b> is small utility to list some simple properties of
sequences in an alignment. 

<p>

It will write a table containing one line per sequence.  The information
is written out in columns separated by space or TAB characters.  The
columns of data are: the sequences' USA, name, two measures of length,
counts of gaps, and numbers of identical, similar and different residues
or bases in this sequence when compared to a reference sequence,
together with a simple statistic of the % change between the reference
sequence and this sequence. 

<p>

The reference sequence can be either the calculated consensus sequence (the default) or it can be one of
the set of aligned sequences, specified by either the ordinal number of that sequence in the input file, or
by its name. 

<p>

Any combination of these types of information can be easily selected or
unselected. 

<p>

By default, the output file starts each line with the USA of the
sequence being described, so the output file is a list file that can be
manually edited and read in by any other EMBOSS program that can read in
one or more sequence to be analysed. 


<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

The set of aligned sequences is read in.

<p>

If the reference sequence is the consensus sequence (this is the
default) then this is calculated.  If the reference sequence is
specified as an ordinal number, then the sequences are counted (from 1)
until the reference sequence is identified.  If the reference sequence
is specified by its name then the names of the sequences are compared to
the specified name until the reference sequence is identified. 

<p>

<pre>
Foreach sequence:
<p>
  Find the position of the first residue or base which is not a gap character.
<br>
  Find the position of the last residue or base which is not a gap character.
<p>
  Foreach position from the first non-gap character to the last non-gap
character:
<p>
    if the position is a gap character, then 
<br>
      increment the 'GapLen' count
<br>
      if this character is the start of a new gap, increment the 'Gaps' count
<br>
    else
<br>
      the character at this position of the sequence and in the
      reference sequence are now compared. 
<br>
      if the sequence character and the reference character are identical 
      (apart from case) then
<br>
        increment the 'Ident' count
<br>
      else if the similarity matrix score for the two characters is > 0
      (i.e.  if they are similar) then
<br>
        increment the 'Similar' count
<br>
      else
<br>
        increment the 'Different' count
<p>
  The 'SeqLen' length of the sequence is the number of non-gap characters
  in the sequence (i.e. 'Ident' + 'Similar' + 'Different')
<p>
  The 'AlignLen' length of the sequence is the length from the first
  non-gap character to the last non-gap character.  (i.e.  the number of
  bases or residues of the sequence plus the number of gap characters
  internal to the sequence.)
<p>
  The '%Change' value for the sequence is calculated as: 
<br>
  ('AlignLen' - 'Ident') * 100 / 'AlignLen'

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<b>infoalign</b> reads a normal multiple sequence alignment file, as
produced by a alignment program. 

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/infoalign.input" -->



<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/infoalign.output" -->

<p>
The first non-blank line is the heading.  This is followed by one line
per sequence containing the following columns of data separated by one
of more space or TAB characters:

<p>

<UL>
<LI> The USA (Uniform Sequence Address) that EMBOSS can use to read in the sequence.
<LI> Name - name of the sequence.
<LI> SeqLen - length of the sequence when all gap characters are removed.
<LI> AlignLen - length of the sequence including internal gap characters i.e. gaps at the start or the end are not included.
<LI> Gaps - number of gaps e.g. 'AAA---AAA' is 1 gap (and 3 gap characters long (see GapLen)).
<LI> GapLen - total number of internal gap characters, see the 3 gap characters above. This is the sum total of all of the internal gap characters in this sequence.
<LI> Ident - number of characters that are identical to the specified reference sequence (uppercase 'A' is identical to lowercase 'a').
<LI> Similar - number of characters which are non-identical - which score > 0 in the comparison matrix when compared to the reference sequence, but which are not identical.
<LI> Different - number of characters which score <= 0 in the comparison matrix when compared to the reference sequence.
<LI> %Change - a simple measure of the percentage change as compared to the reference sequence: (AlignLen - Ident) * 100 / AlignLen
<LI> Description - the description annotation of teh sequence (if any).
</UL>

<p>

If qualifiers to inhibit various columns of information are used, then
the remaining columns of information are output in the same order as
shown above, so if '-noseqlength' is used, the order of output is: usa,
name, alignlength, gaps, gapcount, idcount, simcount, diffcount, change,
description. 

<p>

When the -html qualifier is specified, then the output will be wrapped
in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web page.  Note that tags such as
<HTML> and <BODY> are not output by this program as the table of
databases is expected to form only part of the contents of a web page -
the rest of the web page must be supplier by the user. 

<p>

The lines of output information are guaranteed not to have trailing
white-space at the end. 


<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<b>infoalign</b> reads in scoring matrices to determine the consensus
sequence and to determine which matches are similar or not.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

By default, the output file starts each line with the USA of the
sequence being described, so the output file is a list file that can be
manually edited and read in by other EMBOSS programs using the list-file
specification of '@filename'.
