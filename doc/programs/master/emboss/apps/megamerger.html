<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>megamerger</b> takes two overlapping sequences and merges them into one sequence. 
It could thus be regarded as the opposite of what splitter does.
<P>

The sequences can be very long.
The program does a match of all sequence words of size 20 (by default). It then reduces
this to the minimum set of overlapping matches by sorting the matches in order of size (largest size first)
and then for each such match it removes any smaller matches that overlap. The result is a set of the longest
ungapped alignments between the two sequences that do not overlap with each other. If the two sequences are
identical in their region of overlap then there will be one region of match and no mismatches.
<P>

It should be possible to merge sequences that are Mega bytes long.
Compare this with the program <b>merger</b> which does a more accurate
alignment of more divergent sequences using the Needle and Wunsch algorithm but which uses much more memory.
<P>

The sequences should ideally be identical in their region of overlap.
If there are any mismatches between the two sequences then <b>megamerger</b> will still attempt to
create a merged sequence, but you should check that this is what you required.
<P>

A report of the actions of <b>megamerger</b> is written out.
Any actions that require a choice between using regions of the two sequences
where they have a mismatch is marked with the word <b>WARNING!</b>.
The sequence in these regions is written out in uppercase.
All other regions of the output sequence are written in lowercase.
<p>

Where there is a mismatch then the sequence that is chosen to supply the region of the mismatch in the
final merged sequence is that sequence whose mismatch region is furthest from the start of end of the sequence.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<b>megamerger</b> reads any two Sequence USAs.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/megamerger.input" -->

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/megamerger.output" -->

<p>

A merged sequence is written out.

<p>

Where there has been a mismatch between the two sequences, the merged
sequence is written out in uppercase and the sequence whose mismatch
region is furthest from the edges of the sequence is used in the merged
sequence. 

<p>

The name and description of the first input sequence is used for the
name and description of the output sequence. 

<p>

A report of the merger is written out.

<P>
Compare this with the program <b>merger</b> which does a more accurate
alignment of more divergent sequences using the Needle and Wunsch
algorithm but which uses much more memory.
<P>

A graphical dotplot of the matches used in this merge can be displayed
using the program <b>dotpath</b>.
