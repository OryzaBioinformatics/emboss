<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>jaspscan</b> scans one or more DNA sequences for transcription factor binding sites from the JASPAR database. Matches are searched for using fast sequence word-matching, optionally allowing mismatches.  Because the binding sites are so small, there will be many spurious (false positive) matches.</p>
<p>An output file is written with information on the matches, including sequence ID and accession number, the start and end positions of the match in an input sequence and the sequence of the region where a match has been found. Binding factor information, where available, is given at the end of the matches for each matching entry.</p>

















<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

<!--
