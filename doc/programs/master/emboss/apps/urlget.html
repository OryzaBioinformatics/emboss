<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Retrieves one or more URLs for further information about an identifier
in a data resource.

<p>
EMBOSS can retrieve specific data types (sequences, features,
taxonomy, resources, ontology terms) as defined ACD types.

<p>
Where there is no defined ACD inpu type, EMBOSS can retrieve the text
of a database entry where the information is provided in a
human-readable text format.

<p>
For many data resources there is no retrievable data format. In these
cases EMBOSS can use the Data Resource Catalogue to construct URLs
that can be viewed in the user's preferred browser which should be
able to render them in a meaningful way.





<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

<b>urlget</b> constructs the URL using the information in the Data
Resource Catalogue entry which can be retrieved in its original format
using <b>drget</b>.

<p>
The Query records are searched to find a query that returns HTML data
(not parseable as text). The user-supplied identifier is inserted in
the query to construct a URL.

<p>
If the identifier is specified as a swissprot (<i>-swiss</i>) or EMBL
(<i>-embl</i>) cross-reference the defiitions of swissprot or EMBL
cross-references in the DRCAT entry are used to select queries
matching the identifier type.

<p>
Alternatively, the EDAM term name describing the identifier can be
provided by the user to resolve the selection from multiple queries.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

<b>urlget</b> reads a query containing a database name from DRCAT and
an identifier.

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 

        If you wish to include the standard description of the avalable
	report formats, use:
        #include file="inc/reportformats.ihtml"
   -->

<b>urlget</b> returns a file containing one or more URLs with a description.

<p>
The <i>-oformat</i> qualifier provides a choice of formats which may
be extended in future releases.
