<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>wossdata</b> searches the annotation of application inputs and
outputs in ACD files, using terms from the EDAM ontology. There are
various options for controlling how the search is performed and what
is given in the output file.  Optionally, the output will be wrapped
in HTML tags ready for inclusion in a Web page.</p>




<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

The first search is of the EDAM ontology data namespace, using the
term names and their synonynms. All child terms are automatically
included in the set of matches inless the <tt>-nosubclasses</tt>
qualifier is used.

<p>
The <tt>-sensitive</tt> qualifier also searches the definition strings.

<p>
The set of EDAM terms are then compared to relations in the ACD file,
where input, output and parameter definitions require data references.

    Usage

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->


<p>

<!--#include file="inc/wossdata.input" -->

<b>wossdata</b> reads the brief descriptions and the program groups from
the ACD files.  (ACD files control the parameters that the programs
expect - don't worry about them unless you are writing EMBOSS
programs).




<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

The results are written out as a simple list of program names and
short descriptions.
