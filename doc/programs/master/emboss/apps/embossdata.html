<H2>
    Description
</H2>

This is a utility to indicate which directories can hold EMBOSS
data files and what the names of these files are. 
<p>

The names of EMBOSS data files all start with the character 'E', by
convention, to distinguish them somewhat from any other files,
especially files in your home directory. 

<p>
EMBOSS data files are read in by assorted EMBOSS programs, for
example the files holding the various genetic codes to translate from
nucleic acid codons to amino acids are held in files called "EGC.0",
"EGC.1", "EGC.2", etc.  These files normally are kept in a standard data
directory under the EMBOSS package installation position:
".../emboss/emboss/data/".  When EMBOSS programs require a data file,
they search for it, in order, through the following set of
directories:

<ul>
<li> The current directory
<li> '.embossdata' in the current directory
<li> Your home directory
<li> '.embossdata' in your home directory
<li> The EMBOSS standard data directory
</ul>
<p>
If a data file is placed in the current directory, EMBOSS
programs will use it in preference to the file of the same name in the
EMBOSS standard data directory.  Thus if you wish to modify a
data file to change the behaviour of an EMBOSS program, you
should obtain it from the EMBOSS standard data directory, edit it, and
place it in one of the other directories, such as the current directory
or your home directory. 

<p>
The program embossdata is a utility to enable you to check on
the location of the directories which could hold data files, to display
the names of data files in those directories and to make local copies
of the data files from the EMBOSS standard data directory in
order for you to modify them.
