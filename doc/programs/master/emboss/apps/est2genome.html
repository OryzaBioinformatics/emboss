<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>est2genome</b> is a software tool to aid the prediction of genes by
sequence homology. The program will align a set of spliced nucleotide
sequences (ESTs cDNAs or mRNAs) to an unspliced genomic DNA sequence,
inserting introns of arbitrary length when needed. In addition, where
feasible introns start and stop at the splice consensus dinucleotides
GT and AG.

<p>
Unless instructed otherwise, the program makes three alignments: First
it compares both stands of the spliced sequence against the forward
strand of the genomic, assuming the splice consensus GT/AG (ie in the
forward gene direction). The maximum-scoring orientation is then
realigned assuming the splice consensus CT/AC (ie in the reversed gene
direction). Only the overall maximum-scoring alignment is reported.


<p>
The program outputs a list of the exons and introns it has found. The
format is like that of MSPcrunch, ie a list of matching segments. This
format is easy to parse into other software. The program also
indicates, based on the splice site information, the gene's predicted
direction of transcription. Optionally the full sequence alignment is
printed as well (see the example).

<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>
    
The program uses a linear-space divide-and-conquer strategy (Myers and 
Miller, 1988; Huang, 1994) to limit memory use:

<p>

1. A first pass Smith-Waterman local alignment scan is done to find the 
start and end of the maximally scoring segments.

<p>

2. Subsequences corresponding to these segments are extracted

<p>

3a. If the product of the subsequences' lengths is less than a 
user-defined threshold (i.e. they will fit in memory) the segments are 
realigned using the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm, which 
will give the same result as the Smith-Waterman since the subsequences 
are guaranteed to align end-to-end.

<p>

3b. If the product of the lengths exceeds the threshold (a full 
alignment will not fit in memory) the alignment is made recursively by 
splitting the spliced (EST) sequence in half and finding the genome 
sequence position which aligns with the mid-point. The process is 
repeated until the product of gthe lengths is less than the threshold. 
The divided sequences are aligned separately and then merged.

<p>

4. The genome sequence is searched against the forward and reverse 
strands of the spliced (EST) sequence, assuming a forward gene splicing 
direction (i.e. GT/AG consensus).

<p>

5. Then the best-scoring orientation is realigned assuming reverse 
splicing (CT/AC consensus). The overall best alignment is reported.

<b>est2genome</b> reads two nucleotide sequences. The first is an EST
sequence (a single read or a finished cDNA). The second is a genomic
finished sequence.

    Output file format
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/est2genome.output" -->
<p>

<h3>MSP type segments</h3>

There are four types of segment,

<ol> 
<li>each gapped <b>Exon</b>
<li>each <b>Intron</b> (marked with a ? if it does not start GT and end AG)
<li>the complete alignment <b>Span</b>
<li>individual ungapped matching <b>Segments</b>.
</ol>


<p>

The score for <b>Exon</b> segments is the alignment score excluding
flanking intron penalties. The <b>Span</b> score is the total
including the intron costs.

<p>

The coordinates of the genomic sequence always refer to the positive
strand, but are swapped if the est has been reversed. The splice
direction of Introns are indicated as <b>+Intron</b> (forward, splice
sites GT/AG) or <b>-Intron</b> (reverse, splice sites CT/AC), or
<b>?Intron</b> (unknown direction). <b>Segment</b> entries give the
alignment as a series of ungapped matching segments.


<h3>Full alignment</h3>

You get the alignment if the -align switch is set.  The alignment
includes the first and last 5 bases of each intron, together with the
intron width. The direction of splicing is indicated by
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (forward) or &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; (reverse) or ????
(unknown)

    Notes

<b>est2genome</b> uses a linear-space dynamic-programming 
algorithm. It has the following parameters:

<pre>
parameter               default         description

match                   1               score for matching two bases
mismatch                1               cost for mismatching two bases
gap_penalty             2               cost for deleting a single base in
                                        either sequence, 
                                        excluding introns
intron_penalty          40              cost for an intron, independent of
                                        length.
splice_penalty          20              cost for an intron, independent of
                                        length and starting/ending on
                                        donor-acceptor sites.

space                   10              Space threshold (in  megabytes) 
                                        for linear-space recursion. If the
                                        product of the two sequence 
                                        lengths divided by 4 exceeds this then
                                        a divide-and-conquer strategy is used 
                                        to control the memory requirements. 
                                        In this way very long sequences can
                                        be aligned. 
                                        If you have a machine with plenty of
                                        memory you can raise this parameter
                                        (but do not exceed the machine's
                                        physical RAM)
                                        However, normally you should not need
                                        to change this parameter.
</pre>

There is no gap initiation cost for short gaps, just a penalty
proportional to the length of the gap.  Thus the cost of inserting a
gap of length L in the EST is <pre> L*gap_penalty </pre> and the cost
in the genome is 

<pre> 
min { L*gap_penalty, intron_penalty } or
min { L*gap_penalty, splice_penalty } if the gap starts with GT and ends with AG
                                     (or CT/AC if splice direction reversed)
</pre>

Introns are not allowed in the EST.  The difference between the
intron_penalty and splice_penalty allows for some slack in marking the
intron end-points. It is often the case that the best intron
boundaries, from the point of view of minimising mismatches, will not
coincide exactly with the splice consensus, so provided the difference
between the intron/splice penalties outweighs the extra mismatch/indel
costs the alignment will respect the proper boundaries. If the
alignment still prefers boundaries which don't start and end with the
splice consensus then this may indicate errors in the sequences.


<p> The default parameters work well, except for very short exons
(length less than the splice_penalty, approx) which may be
skipped. The intron penalties should not be set to less that the
maximum expected random match between the sequences (typically 10-15
bp) in order to avoid spurious matches.

The algorithm has the following steps:

<ol>
<li> A first-pass Smith-Waterman scan is done to locate the score, start
and end of the maximal scoring segment (including introns of
course). No other alignment information is retained.

<li> Subsequences corresponding to the maximal-scoring segments are
extracted.  If the product of these subsequences' lengths is less than
the area parameter then the segments are re-aligned using the
Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, which in this instance will give the same
result as the Smith-Waterman since they are guaranteed to align
end-to-end.

<li> If the product of lengths exceeds the area threshold then the
alignment is recursively broken down by splitting the EST in half and
finding the genome position which aligns with the EST mid-point. The
problem then reduces to aligning the left-hand and right-hand portions
of the sequences separately and merging the result. 
</ol>

The worst-case run-time for the algorithm is about 3 times as long as
would be taken to align using a quadratic-space program. In practice
the maximal-scoring segment is often much shorter than the full genome
length so the program runs only about 1.5 times slower.
