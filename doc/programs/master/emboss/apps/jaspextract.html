<H2>
    Description
</H2>


   JASPAR is a collection of transcription factor DNA-binding preferences,
   modelled as matrices. These can be converted into Position Weight
   Matrices (PWMs or PSSMs), used for scanning genomic sequences.

<p>
   JASPAR is the only database with this scope where the data can be used
   with no restrictions (open-source).

<p>
   This program copies the 3 JASPAR matrix sets into the EMBOSS
   data directories, performing any necessary conversions.

<p>
   The home page of JASPAR
   is: <a href="http://jaspar.genereg.net/">http://jaspar.genereg.net/</a>

<p>
   The EMBOSS program jaspscan will not work unless this program is run.

<p>
   Running this program may be the job of your system manager.


<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.
 -->

<!--#include file="inc/jaspextract.usage" -->



<H2>
    Command line arguments
</H2>

<table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=3 BGCOLOR="#f5f5ff" ><tr><td>
<pre>
<!--#include file="inc/jaspextract.ihelp" -->
</pre>
</td></tr></table>

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->


<!--#include file="inc/jaspextract.input" -->


   The input files are the uncompressed and extracted JASPAR_CORE.tgz,
   JASPAR_FAM.tgz and JASPAR_PHYLOFACTS.tgz files provided in the JASPAR
   MatrixDir download directory of the JASPAR homepage
   <a href="http://jaspar.genereg.net">(http://jaspar.genereg.net).</a>
<p>
   The files will usually be extracted in the same directory thereby
   creating a directory containing subdirectories JASPAR_CORE,
   JASPAR_FAM and JASPAR_PHYLOFACTS. Given a directory specification,
   jasparextract will search for these subdirectories and process the
   files in any that exist. jasparextract will warn the user if any
   of the three subdirectories do not exist.



<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 

        If you wish to include the standard description of the avalable
	report formats, use:
        #include file="inc/reportformats.ihtml"
   -->

  The output file format is currently the same as the JASPAR
  distribution format.

<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

<!-- 
        Potentially stupid things the program will let you do.
   -->

  The program will warn you if any of the JASPAR_CORE, JASPAR_FAM or
   JASPAR_PHYLOFACTS subdirectories do not exist.
