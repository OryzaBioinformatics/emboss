<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<p><b>extractseq</b> reads a sequence and writes sub-sequences from it to file. The set of regions to extract is specified on the command-line or in a file as pairs of start and end positions.  The regions are written in the order in which they are specified. Thus, if the sequence <tt>AAAGGGTTT</tt> has been input and the regions: <tt>7-9, 3-4</tt> have been specified, then the output sequence will be: <tt>TTTAG</tt>. Optionally, each region may be written out as a separate sequence.</p>

<b>extractseq</b> reads a normal sequence USA.

<p>
<!--#include file="inc/extractseq.input" -->

<p>

You can specifiy a file of ranges to extract by giving the '-regions'
qualifier the value '@' followed by the name of the file containing the
ranges. (eg: '-regions @myfile').

<p>
The format of the range file is:

<ul>
<li>Comment lines start with '#' in the first column.
<li>Comment lines and blank lines are ignored.
<li>The line may start with white-space.
<li>There are two positive (integer) numbers per line separated by one or
        more space or TAB characters. 
<li>The second number must be greater or equal to the first number.
<li>There can be optional text after the two numbers to annotate the line. 
<li>White-space before or after the text is removed.
</ul>

<p>

An example range file is:

<pre>

# this is my set of ranges
12   23
 4   5       this is like 12-23, but smaller
67   10348   interesting region

</pre>

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


The output is a normal sequence file.

<p>
<!--#include file="inc/extractseq.output" -->
<p>

If the option '-separate' is used then each specified region is written
to the output file as a separate sequence.  The name of the sequence is
created from the name of the original sequence with the start and end
positions of the range appended with underscore characters between them,

<p>

For example: "XYZ region 2 to 34" is written as: "XYZ_2_34"

    Notes
</H2>

<p><b>extractseq</b> allows you to specify one or more regions of a sequence to extract sub-sequences from to build up a contiguous output sequence.  This is modelled on the cell's process of splicing out exons from mRNA, but the program is generally applicable to any cutting and splicing or editing operation on a single sequence.</p>
<p>Where the <tt>-regions</tt> option is used to specify output as separate sequences, the name of the sequence is created from the name of the original sequence with the start and end positions of the range appended with underscore characters between them, eg: XYZ region 2 to 34 is written as: <tt>XYZ_2_34</tt>.  In such cases the output sequence foramt must be capable of supporting multiple sequences.</p>

    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>


Several warning messages about malformed region specifications: 

<ul>
<li>       Non-digit found in region ... 

<li>       Unpaired start of a region found in ... 

<li>       Non-digit found in region ... 

<li>       The start of a pair of region positions must be smaller than the
	end in ... 

</ul>
	
<H2>
    Exit status
</H2>


It exits with status 0, unless a region is badly constructed.
