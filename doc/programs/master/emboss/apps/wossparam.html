<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>wossparam</b> searches the annotation of application parameters in ACD files, using terms from the EDAM ontology. There are various options for controlling how the search is performed and what is given in the output file.  Optionally, the output will be wrapped in HTML tags ready for inclusion in a Web page.</p>


<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

The first search is of the EDAM ontology data namespace, using the
term names and their synonynms. All child terms are automatically
included in the set of matches inless the <tt>-nosubclasses</tt>
qualifier is used.

<p>
The <tt>-sensitive</tt> qualifier also searches the definition strings.

<p>
The set of EDAM terms are then compared to relations in the non input
or output datatypes of the ACD file, where input and output
definitions require EDAM data references.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>


<p>

<!--#include file="inc/wossparam.input" -->

<p>
<b>wossparam</b> reads the brief descriptions and the program groups from
the ACD files.  (ACD files control the parameters that the programs
expect - don't worry about them unless you are writing EMBOSS
programs).




<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

The results are written out as a simple list of program names and
short descriptions.
