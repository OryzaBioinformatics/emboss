<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
  -->

<p><b>cons</b> calculates a consensus sequence from a multiple
  sequence alignment. To obtain the consensus, the amino acid residue
  or nucleotide at each position is compared to the possible ambiguity
  codes. The consensus sequence uses the minimum ambiguity code match.</p>














<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

<!-- 
        Algorithms
	  Pseudocode/Vague description/Handwaving/web links to useful pages
  -->


The ambiguity codes are defined in local data files. <b>consambig</b>
uses these files to determine which codes match all residues or
nucleotides in the input sequences at each position.











<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>



The USA of a set of aligned sequences.

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 

        If you wish to include the standard description of the avalable
	report formats, use:
        #include file="inc/reportformats.ihtml"
   -->

The output consists of a sequence file holding the consensus sequence.

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<p><b>consambig</b> uses the standard files Ebases.iub and Eresidues.iub in
the EMBOSS data directory.</p>
