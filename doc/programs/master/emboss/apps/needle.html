    Description
</H2>


<p><b>needle</b> reads two input sequences and writes their optimal global sequence alignment to file. It uses the Needleman-Wunsch alignment algorithm to find the optimum alignment (including gaps) of two sequences along their entire length. The algorithm uses a dynamic programming method to ensure the alignment is optimum, by exploring all possible alignments and choosing the best. A scoring matrix is read that contains values for every possible residue or nucleotide match. Needle finds the alignment with the maximum possible score where the score of an alignment is equal to the sum of the matches taken from the scoring matrix, minus a penalties arising from opening and extending gaps in the aligned sequences.  The substitution matrix and gap opening and extension penalties are user-specified.</p>


<H3>
    Algorithm
</H3>


<p>The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a member of the class of algorithms that can calculate the best score and alignment of two sequences in the order of <tt>mn</tt> steps, where <tt>n</tt> and <tt>m</tt> are the sequence lengths.  These dynamic programming algorithms were first developed for protein sequence comparison by Needleman and Wunsch, though similar methods were independently devised during the late 1960's and early 1970's for use in the fields of speech processing and computer science.</p>

<p>An important problem is the treatment of gaps, i.e., spaces inserted to optimise the alignment score. A penalty is subtracted from the score for each gap opened (the 'gap open' penalty) and a penalty is subtracted from the score for the total number of gap spaces multiplied by a cost (the 'gap extension' penalty). Typically, the cost of extending a gap is set to be 5-10 times lower than the cost for opening a gap.</p>

<p>There are two ways to compute a penalty for a gap of n positions :

<pre>gap opening penalty + (n - 1) * gap extension penalty
gap penalty + n * gap length penalty</pre>

The two methods are basically equivalent.  The first way is used by EMBOSS and WU-BLAST. The second way is used by NCBI-BLAST, GCG, Staden and CLUSTAL. Fasta for a long time used the first way, but recently shifted to the second.
</p>

<p>In a Needleman-Wunsch global alignment, the entire length of each sequence is aligned. The sequences might be partially overlapping or one sequence might be aligned entirely internally to the other.  There is no penalty for the hanging ends of the overlap. In bioinformatics, it is usually reasonable to assume that the sequences are incomplete and there should be no penalty for failing to align the missing bases.</p>

<!--#include file="inc/alignformats.ihtml" -->

<p>


<!--#include file="inc/needle.output" -->

<p>

The <b>Identity:</b> is the percentage of identical matches between the two
sequences over the reported aligned region (including any gaps in the length).

<p>

The <b>Similarity:</b> is the percentage of matches between the two
sequences over the reported aligned region (including any gaps in the length).

For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution
matrix. For nucleotide sequence, EDNAFULL is used. Others can be
specified.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<b>needle</b> is a true implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm and so produces a full path matrix. It therefore cannot be
used with genome sized sequences unless you've a lot of memory and a
lot of time.

<b>needle</b> is for aligning two sequences over their entire length.  This
works best with closely related sequences.  If you use needle to align
very distantly-related sequences, it will produce a result but much of
the alignment may have little or no biological significance. 

<p>

A true Needleman Wunsch implementation like <b>needle</b> needs memory
proportional to the product of the sequence lengths.  For two sequences
of length 10,000,000 and 1,000 it therefore needs memory proportional to
10,000,000,000 characters.  Two arrays of this size are produced, one of
ints and one of floats so multiply that figure by 8 to get the memory
usage in bytes.  That doesn't include other overheads.  Therefore only
use water and needle for accurate alignment of reasonably short
sequences.

<p>

If you run out of memory, try using 
<b>stretcher</b> instead.

<P>
When you want an alignment that covers the whole length of both
sequences, use <a href="needle.html">needle. </A> 

<p>
When you are trying to find the best region of similarity between two
sequences, use <a href="water.html">water.</a>
<p>

<a href="stretcher.html">stretcher</a> is a more suitable program to use to
find global alignments of very long sequences.
