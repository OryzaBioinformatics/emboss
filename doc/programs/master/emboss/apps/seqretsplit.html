    Function
</H2>
<!--#include file="inc/seqretsplit.ione" -->

<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>seqretsplit</b> is exactly the same as the program <b>seqret</b>
except that when it writes out more than one sequence, it writes each
sequence to an individual file. 
<P>

Its main use is therefore to split a file containing multiple sequences
into many files, each containing one sequence. 
<p>

The names of the files it creates are derived from the ID name of the
sequence, followed by an extension denoting the format of the sequence. 
You have no control over the names of the files it writes out. 
<P>

For example, if the files <i>embl:hsfa11*</i> are read in and the
output is specified as <i>wibble.seq</i>, then the following files are
expected to be created:
<P>

<pre>
hsfa110.fasta
hsfa111.fasta
hsfa112.fasta
hsfa113.fasta
hsfa114.fasta
</pre>
<p>
(No file <i>wibble.seq</i> is created.)
<p>

Why would you want to split a multiple sequence file into many
individual files? 
<p>

EMBOSS programs can read in many sequences from one file where this is
sensible.  Sometimes EMBOSS programs can only read in one sequence at a
time because that is the sensible way to do things, but your sequence is
one sequence of many in a file.  You can specify that sequence using the
USA <i>filename:sequenceID</i>, but you may still feel more comfortable
splitting your sequences up into many files first.
<p>

Many non-EMBOSS programs will also have restrictions on whether they can
read in multiple sequence files or not.
<p>


<H2>
    Usage
</H2>
<!--#include file="inc/seqretsplit.usage" -->

<p>

The specification of the output file is not used in this case.
<p>

At some point this ought to change and you will not be prompted for the
output file at all.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<b>seqretsplit</b> reads a normal sequence USA.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/seqretsplit.input" -->


<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/seqretsplit.output" -->

<p>

One file for each input sequence is written out.

<p>

The names of the files it creates are derived from the ID name of the
sequence, followed by an extension denoting the format of the sequence. 
You have no control over the names of the files it writes out. 

<p>

For example, if the files <i>embl:hsfa11*</i> are read in and the
output is specified as <i>wibble.seq</i>, then the following files are
expected to be created:

<p>

<pre>
hsfa110.fasta
hsfa111.fasta
hsfa112.fasta
hsfa113.fasta
hsfa114.fasta
</pre>

<p>

(No file <i>wibble.seq</i> is created.)

<H2>
    Data files

None.

None.

    Warnings
</H2>

None.

<H2>
    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

None.

<H2>
    Exit status
</H2>

It always exits with status 0.

<H2>
    Known bugs
</H2>

It shouldn't really prompt for the output filename.
<p>
This isa side effect of the waysequence output works in
EMBOSS. Writing multiple sequences to separate files (the -ossingle
qualifier) does this, and seqretsplit has set it automatically on.
