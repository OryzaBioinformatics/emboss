    Description
</H2>


<p><b>seqret</b> reads in one or more sequences and writes them out again. The sequence input may be a literal sequence or read from a database, file, file of sequence names, or even the command-line or the output of another programs. The sequence output can be written to screen, to file, or passed to another program. A wide range of standard sequence formats may be specified for input and output.  If you don't specify the input format, <b>seqret</b> will try a set of possible formats until it reads it in successfully. The sequence input and output, as for all EMBOSS programs, is described by a Uniform Sequence Address.  This is is a very flexible way of specifying one or more sequences from a variety of sources and includes sequence files, database queries and external applications.</p>

<p>There are many options built-in into EMBOSS for detailed specification of the input and output sequences, for example the sequence type, file format. specification of sequence regions by begin and end positions, or generation of the reverse complement of a nucleic acid sequence.  On output <b>seqret</b> can change the case of the sequence to upper or to lower case. </p>

<p><b>seqret</b> is useful for a variety of tasks, including extracting sequences from databases, displaying sequences, reformatting sequences, producing the reverse complement of a sequence, extracting fragments of a sequence, sequence case conversion or any combination of the above functions.</p>

    Input file format
</H2>


<b>seqret</b> reads one or more sequence USAs.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/seqret.input" -->

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


The output from <b>seqret</b> is one or more sequences, and by default will be
written in FASTA format. 

<p>

If the '-firstonly' qualifier is used then only the first sequence of the
input USA specification will be written out. 

<p>

In some cases the output filename will be the same as the input
filename, but as <b>seqret</b> reads only the first sequence before opening
the output file it may try to overwrite the input.  Note that this is
not true of <b>seqretset</b> which reads all sequences into memory at
startup, but which can need a large amount of memory for many sequences.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

This description of what you can do when reading or writing files is not
specific to the program <b>seqret</b>.  All EMBOSS programs that read or write
sequences can do the same. 

<p>

<b>seqret</b> is often one of the first programs taught in EMBOSS training
courses.  This is because it is versatile, it is extremely powerful for
its size (17 lines of code) it illustrates many aspects of EMBOSS
programs and it was one of the first EMBOSS programs to be written, so
it has a special place in the hearts of EMBOSS developers. 

<p>

The name '<b>seqret</b>' derives both from its function ("sequence return") and
from the fact that immense amounts of functionality can come from so few
lines of source code - most of the work is done by the EMBOSS libraries
which the program calls and whose complexity is hidden, or "secret". 

<p>
The simplicity of the above description of this program greatly
understates the rich functionality of this program. 

<p>

Because EMBOSS programs can take a wide range of qualifiers that
slightly change the behaviour of the program when reading or writing a
sequence, this program can do many more things than simply "read and
write a sequence". 

<p>

<b>seqret</b> can read a sequence or many sequences from databases, files,
files of sequence names, the command-line or the output of other
programs and then can write them to files, the screen or pass them to
other programs.  Because it can read in a sequence from a database and
write it to a file, <b>seqret</b> is a program for extracting sequences from
databases.  Because it can write the sequence to the screen, <b>seqret</b> is a
program for displaying sequences. 

<p>

<b>seqret</b> can read sequences in any of a wide range of standard sequence
formats.  You can specify the input and output formats being used.  If
you don't specify the input format, <b>seqret</b> will try a set of possible
formats until it reads it in successfully.  Because you can specify the
output sequence format, <b>seqret</b> is a program to reformat a sequence. 

<p>

<b>seqret</b> can read in the reverse complement of a nucleic acid sequence. 
It therefore is a program for producing the reverse complement of a
sequence. 

<p>

<b>seqret</b> can read in a sequence whose begin and end positions you have
specified and write out that fragment.  It is therefore a utility for
doing simple extraction of a region of a sequence. 

<p>

<b>seqret</b> can change the case of the sequence being read in to upper or to
lower case.  It is therefore a simple sequence beautification utility. 

<p>

<b>seqret</b> can do any combination of the above functions.

<p>

The sequence input and output specification of this (and many other
EMBOSS programs) is described as being a Uniform Sequence Address. 

<p>

The Uniform Sequence Address, or USA, is a somewhat tongue-in-cheek
reference to a URL-style sequence naming used by all EMBOSS
applications. 

<p>

The USA is a very flexible way of specifying one or more sequences from
a variety of sources and includes sequence files, database queries and
external applications. 

<p>

See the full specification of USA syntax at:
<br>
<a href="http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/themes/UniformSequenceAddress.html">
http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/themes/UniformSequenceAddress.html
</a>

<p>

The basic USA syntax is one of: 

<ul>
<li>"file" 
<li>"file:entry" 
<li>"format::file" 
<li>"format::file:entry" 
<li>"database:entry" 
<li>"database"
<li>"@file" 
</ul>

<p>

Note that ':' separates the name of a file containing many possible
entries from the specific name of a sequence entry in that file.  It
also separates the name of a database from an entry in that database

<p>

Note also that '::' separates the specified format of a file from the
name of the file.  Normally the format can be omitted, in which case the
program will attempt to identify the correct format when reading the
sequence in and will default to using FASTA format when writing the
sequence out. 

<p>

Valid names of the databases set up in your local implementation of
EMBOSS can be seen by using the program '<a href="showdb.html">showdb</a>'.

<p>

Database queries, and individual entries in files that have more than
one sequence entry, use wildcards of "?" for any character and "*" for
any string of characters.  There are some problems with the Unix shell
catching these characters so they do need to be hidden in quotes or
preceded by a backslash on the Unix command line, (for example
"embl:hs\*")

<p>

The output USA name 'stdout' is special.  It makes the output go to the
device 'standard output'.  This is the screen, by default. 

<p>

<h3>Example USAs</h3>

The following are valid USAs for sequences:

<h3>Input sequence formats</h3>

To date, the following sequence formats are accepted as
input.
<P>

By default, (i.e.  if no format is explicitly specified) EMBOSS tries
each format in turn until one succeeds.

<h3>Output sequence formats</h3>

To date, the following sequence formats are available as output.
<p>

Some sequence formats can hold multiple sequences in one file, these are
marked as <b>multiple</b> in the following table.  The details of how many
sequences are held in one file differs between formats, but they either
allow many sequences to be concatenated one after the other, or they
hold the sequences together in some sort of aligned set of sequences.
<P>

Other formats, such as GCG, plain and staden formats can only hold one
sequence per file, these are marked as <b>single</b>.  An attempt to
concatenate several sequences in one file leaves the results as a mess
that makes it impossible to decide where the sequences start and end or
what is annotation and what is sequence. 
<p>
   
These <b>single</b> formats therefore cause problems when there are
multiple sequences to write out because a single file containing
multiple sequences in that format is invalid.  When these formats are
specified for output, an EMBOSS program will allow you to write many
sequences to one file, but EMBOSS programs will not be able to reliably
read in the resulting mess. 
<p>

<B>N.B</B> This behaviour changed in EMBOSS version 1.7.0.  (31 Oct
2000) Previously, EMBOSS programs that were asked to write multiple
sequences in a <b>single</b> format would ignore the requested output
file name and would write each sequence into a separate file whose name
was constructed from the sequence name and the name of the format.  This
resulted in ouput to files whose names could not be reliably controlled. 
A decision was taken that EMBOSS users were intelligent people who could
live with the consequences of their actions and who could learn not to
write out multiple sequences to a file in formats that could not cope
with multiple sequences. 
<P>

It you really wish to write multiple sequences out in formats that can
not cope with multiple sequences, you are advised to add the global
qualifier <b>-ossingle</b> on the command line.  This will force the
EMBOSS program to ignore the given output file name and will generate its
own file names.  One sequence will be written to each such file.  These file
names are made from the sequence ID name, with the name of the format as
the extension (e.g.  <b>x65923.gcg</b>). 
<P>

This is not ideal.  Preferably, you should stay away from formats that
can't cope with multiple sequences in a file. 
<P>

<h3>Future directions</h3>

More formats, both for input and for output, can be easily added, so
suggestions are always welcome. 



<h3>Associated qualifiers</h3>

<p>

As noted previously there are many 'associated' qualifiers that alter
the behaviour of <b>seqret</b> when it reads in or writes out a sequence.  As
these are used in all EMBOSS programs that read in or write out
sequences, they are not reported by the '-help' qualifier.  They are
however reported by the pair of qualifiers: '-help -verbose':


<p>

Some of the more useful associated qualifiers are:

<table border=3>
<tr><th>Qualifier</th>		<th>Description</th></tr>

<tr><td>-sbegin</td><td>The first position to be used in the sequence</td></tr>
<tr><td>-send</td><td>The last position to be used in the sequence</td></tr>
<tr><td>-sreverse</td><td>Use the reverse complement of a nucleic acid sequence</td></tr>
<tr><td>-sask</td><td>Ask the user for begin/end/reverse information</td></tr>
<tr><td>-slower</td><td>Convert the sequence to lower case</td></tr>
<tr><td>-supper</td><td>Convert the sequence to upper case</td></tr>
<tr><td>-sformat</td><td>Specify the input sequence format</td></tr>
<tr><td>-osformat</td><td>Specify the output sequence format</td></tr>
<tr><td>-ossingle</td><td>Write each entry into a separate file</td></tr>
<tr><td>-auto</td><td>Turn off prompts and don't report the one-line description</td></tr>
<tr><td>-stdout</td><td>Write the results to 'standard output' (the screen)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-filter</td><td>Read input from another program, write to the screen</td></tr>
<tr><td>-options</td><td>Prompt for optional qualifiers</td></tr>
<tr><td>-help</td><td>Display a table of the command-line options</td></tr>
</table>

<p>

The set of associated qualifiers for sequences behave in different ways
depending on where they appear. 

<p>

If these qualifiers immediately follow a parameter they apply only to
that parameter and not to all cases.  If they occur before any
parameters, they apply to all following sequence parameters. 

<p>

If there are no two parameters of equal type, the order of parameters
and their qualifiers is irrelevant. 

<p>

Where a qualifier is defined more than once, for example "-sformat" for
2 input sequences to be aligned, the qualifier name can have a number to
indicate which sequence is meant.  "-sbegin2=25" will apply only to the
second sequence, no matter where it appears on the command line. 

<p>

The -sbegin and -send qualifiers take an integer number specifying the
position to begin or end reading a sequence.  If the number is positive,
the number is the position counting from the first base or residue of
the sequence.  If the number is negative the position is counted from
the end of the sequence, so position -1 is the last base or residue of
the sequence.  (If -sbegin 0 is used, it is assumed to be the same as
-sbegin 1 and -send 0 is the same as -send -1.)

<p>

The filter qualifier makes the program behave like a filter, reading its
(first) input 'file' from the standard input, and writing its (first)
output 'file' to the standard output.  The -filter qualifier will also
invoke the -auto qualifier, so the user is never prompted for any
missing values. 

<p>

Example:

<pre>

% cat sequence.seq | seqret -filter | lpr

</pre>

<p>

The example shows the application <b>seqret</b> being run with the -filter
qualifier.  The input file is 'piped' into the program using the unix
command cat and the output is 'piped' directly to the unix program lpr,
which will print it on the printer. 

<p>

When the -options qualifier is used and not all the parameters are given
on the command line, it will query the user for those parameters.  It
will not only query the user for the required parameters as it would do
without the -options qualifier, but it will also query the user for the
optional parameters.

<p>

When the -stdout qualifier is used, the user will still be prompted for
all the info that is required, but will write to standard output by
default.  The user will also still be prompted for an output filename,
in case the user wants to save the output to a file.
