<H2>
    Description
</H2>


<p><b>maskseq</b> reads a sequence and writes a masked version of it to file. The sequence is masked in a specified set of regions such that characters in that region are (optionally) converted to lower case and / or (optionally) replaced with the specified mask character.</p>

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>


<b>maskseq</b> reads in a single sequence USA.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/maskseq.input" -->

<p>

You can specify a file of ranges to mask out by giving the '-regions'
qualifier the value '@' followed by the name of the file containing the
ranges. (eg: '-regions @myfile').

<p>

The format of the range file is:

<ul>
<li>Comment lines start with '#' in the first column.
<li>Comment lines and blank lines are ignored.
<li>The line may start with white-space.
<li>There are two positive (integer) numbers per line separated by one or
	more space or TAB characters. 
<li>The second number must be greater or equal to the first number.
<li>There can be optional text after the two numbers to annotate the line. 
<li>White-space before or after the text is removed.
</ul>

<p>

An example range file is:

<p>

<hr>
<pre>
# this is my set of ranges
12   23
 4   5       this is like 12-23, but smaller
67   10348   interesting region
</pre>
<hr>

    Notes
</H2>

<p>It is common for database searches to mask out low-complexity or biased composition regions of a sequence so that spurious matches do not occur. It is possible that you have a program that has reported such biased regions but which has not masked the sequence itself. In that case, you can use this program to do the masking.</p>

<p>There are other uses for it. For example, some non-EMBOSS programs (for example FASTA) are capable of treating lower-case regions as if they are masked. <b>maskseq</b> can mask a region to lower-case instead of replacing the sequence with <tt>N</tt>'s or <tt>X</tt>'s if you use the qualifier <tt>-tolower</tt> or use a space character as the masking character.</p>

    Warnings
</H2>


You can mask out a complete sequence.

<H2>
    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>


Several warning messages about malformed region specifications:
<p>

<ul>
	<li>Non-digit found in region ...
	<li>Unpaired start of a region found in ...
	<li>Non-digit found in region ...
	<li>The start of a pair of region positions must be smaller than the
		end in ... 
</ul>

<H2>
    Exit status
</H2>


	It exits with status 0, unless a region is badly constructed.

<H2>
    Known bugs
</H2>

None.
