<!--#include file="inc/restover.ione" -->

<H2>
    Description
</H2>

The Restriction Enzyme database (REBASE) is a collection of information
about restriction enzymes and related proteins.  It contains published
and unpublished references, recognition and cleavage sites,
isoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation sensitivity, crystal
and sequence data.  DNA methyltransferases, homing endonucleases,
nicking enzymes, specificity subunits and control proteins are also
included.  Most recently, putative DNA methyltransferases and
restriction enzymes, as predicted from analysis of genomic sequences,
are also listed. 

<p>

The home page of REBASE is: 
<A HREF="http://rebase.neb.com/">http://rebase.neb.com/</A>

<p>

<b>restover</b> takes a specified sequence and a short sequence of a
cut-site overhang and searches the REBASE database for matching enzymes
that create the desired overhang sequence when they cut the
input sequence.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<b>restover</b> reads in a normal nucleic acid sequence USA.

<p>

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/restover.output" -->

<p>

The output from <b>restover</b> is a simple text one.  The base number,
restriction enzyme name, recognition site and cut positions are shown. 
Note that cuts are always to the right of the residue shown and that 5'
cuts are referred to by their associated 3' number sequence.  The
program reports enzymes that cut at two or four sites.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

The data files must have been created before running this program.  This
is done by running the <b>rebaseextract</b> program with the "withrefm" file
from an REBASE release.  You may have to ask your system manager to do
this.
