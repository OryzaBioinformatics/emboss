<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>yank</b> is a simple utility to add a specified sequence name to a
list file. 

<p>

In fact, it writes out not just the name of the sequence, but also the
start and end position of a region within that sequence and, if the
sequence is nucleic, if can specify whether the sequence is the reverse
complement. 

<p>

Without the program <b>yank</b> you would need to use a text editor such
as <i>pico</i> to create the appropriate list files.  <b>yank</b>
makes this process easy. 


<H3>List Files</H3>

Many EMBOSS programs can read in a set of sequences.  (Some examples are
<b>emma</b> and <b>union</b>) There are many ways of specifying these
sequences, including wildcarded sequence file names, wildcarded database
entry names and list files.  List files (files of file names) are the
most flexible. <b>yank</b> is a utility to add sequences to a list file.

<p>


Instead of containing the sequences themselves, a List file contains
"references" to sequences - so, for example, you might include database
entries, the names of files containing sequences, or even the names of
other list files.  For example, here's a valid list file, called
<i>seq.list</i>:

<p>
<pre>
unix % more seq.list 

opsd_abyko.fasta
sw:opsd_xenla
sw:opsd_c*
@another_list
</pre>

<p>

This looks a bit odd, but it's really very straightforward; the file
contains:

<p>

<ul>
      <li><b>opsd_abyko.fasta</b> - this is the name of a sequence file. The file is read in from the current directory. 
      <li><b>sw:opsd_xenla</b> - this is a reference to a specific sequence in the SwissProt database 
      <li><b>sw:opsd_c*</b> - this represents all the sequences in SwissProt whose identifiers start with ``opsd_c'' 
      <li><b>another_list</b> - this is the name of a second list file 
</ul>

<p>

Notice the <b>@</b> in front of the last entry.  This is the way you tell
EMBOSS that this file is a list file, not a regular sequence file.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<b>yank</b> reads any valid sequence USA.

<p>

You will be prompted for the start and end positions you wish to use.

<p>

If the sequence is nucleic, you will be prompted whether you wish to use
the reverse complement of the sequence. 

<p>

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/yank.output" -->


<p>

The output list file can now be read in by a program such as
<b>union</b> by specifying the list file as '@cds.list' when
<b>union</b> prompts for input.

<!--#include file="inc/yank.isee" -->
<p>

The program <b>extract</b> does not make list files, but creates a
sequence from sub-regions of a single other sequence.
