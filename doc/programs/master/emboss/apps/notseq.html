<!--#include file="inc/notseq.ione" -->



<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<p><b>notseq</b> writes to file a subset of an input stream of sequences. The list of sequence names or accession numbers to exclude from output is provided as a string.  Optionally, the excluded sequences are also written to file.</p>





<H2>
    Usage

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>
<b>notseq</b> reads normal sequence USAs.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/notseq.input" -->

<p>

The names (or accession numbers) of the sequences to be excluded can be
entered as a file of such names by specifying an '@' followed by the
name of the file containing the sequence names.  For example:
'@names.dat'. 

<p>

The names or accession numbers of the sequences to be
excluded are not standard EMBOSS USAs.  Only the ID name or accession
number can be specified, you cannot specify the sequences as
'database:ID', 'file:accession', 'format::file', etc. 




<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<b>notseq</b> writes normal a sequence file.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/notseq.output" -->


<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

None.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<p><b>notseq</b> was written for the case where a file containing several sequences was being used as a small database, but some of the sequences were no longer required. <b>notseq</b> splits the input sequences into those that you wish to keep and those you wish to exclude.</p>

<p>Wildcarded names and accession numbers may be specified in the input string by using <tt>*</tt>.</p>

<p>The names (or accession numbers) of the sequences to be excluded can be entered as a file of such names by specifying an <tt>@</tt> followed by the name of the file containing the sequence names. For example: <tt>@names.dat</tt>.</p>


<H2>
    References
</H2>


None.

<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

<p>The input string does not support the full USA syntax; only the name or accession number should be specified, not the database or file that these entries may occur in.</p>

<H2>
    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

If no matches are found to any of the specified sequence names, the message
"This is a warning: No matches found." is displayed.


<H2>
    Exit status
</H2>

It exits with a status of 0 unless no matches are found to any of the
input sequences name, in which case it exits with a status of -1. 


<H2>
    Known bugs
</H2>

None.
