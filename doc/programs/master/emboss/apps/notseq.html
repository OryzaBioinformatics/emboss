<H2>
    Description
</H2>

When you have a set of sequences (a file of multiple sequences?) and you
wish to remove one or more of them from the set, then use <b>notseq</b>. 

<p>

This program was written for the case where a file containing several
sequences is being used as a small database, but some of the sequences
are no longer required and must be deleted from the file. 

<p>

<b>notseq</b> splits the input sequences into those that you wish to
keep and those you wish to exclude. 

<p>

<b>notseq</b> takes a set of sequences as input together with a list of
sequence names or accession numbers.  It also takes the name of a new
file to write the files that you want to keep into, and optionally the
name of a file that will contain the files that you want excluded from
the set. 

<p>

<b>notseq</b> then reads in the input sequences.  It outputs the ones
that match one of the sequence names or acession numbers to the file of
excluded sequences, and those that don't match are output to the file of
sequences to be kept. 

<p>

Note that the names of the sequences to be excluded are not standard
EMBOSS USAs.  Only the name or accession number shoudl be specified, not
the database or file that these entries may occur in.  These excluded
sequence names will be matched against the names of the input sequences
to see if there is a match.  Wildcarded names may be specified by using
'*'s.  Any specified names of sequences to be excluded that are not
found are simply ignored.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>
<b>notseq</b> reads normal sequence USAs.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/notseq.input" -->

<p>

The names (or accession numbers) of the sequences to be excluded can be
entered as a file of such names by specifying an '@' followed by the
name of the file containing the sequence names.  For example:
'@names.dat'. 

<p>

The names or accession numbers of the sequences to be
excluded are not standard EMBOSS USAs.  Only the ID name or accession
number can be specified, you cannot specify the sequences as
'database:ID', 'file:accession', 'format::file', etc. 




<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<b>notseq</b> writes normal a sequence file.

None.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

Note that the names or accession numbers of the sequences to be
excluded are not standard EMBOSS USAs.  Only the ID name or accession
number can be specified, you cannot specify the sequences as
'database:ID', 'file:accession', 'format::file', etc. 

<H2>
    References
</H2>


None.

<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

None.

<H2>
    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

If no matches are found to any of the specified sequence names, the message
"This is a warning: No matches found." is displayed.


<H2>
    Exit status
</H2>

It exits with a status of 0 unless no matches are found to any of the
input sequences name, in which case it exits with a status of -1. 


<H2>
    Known bugs
</H2>

None.
