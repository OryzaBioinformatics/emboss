<!--#include file="inc/infoseq.ione" -->


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This is a small utility to list the sequences' USA, name, accession
number, type (nucleic or protein), length, percentage C+G, and/or
description. 

<p>
Any combination of these types of information can be easily selected or
unselected. 

<p>
By default, the output file starts each line with the USA of the
sequence being described, so the output file is a list file that can be
manually edited and read in by any other EMBOSS program that can read in
one or more sequence to be analysed. 

<H2>
    Usage

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>


<b>infoseq</b> reads any sequence USAs.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/infoseq.input" -->

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


	The output is displayed on the screen (stdout) by default.
<p>
	
<!--#include file="inc/infoseq.output" -->

<p>

The first non-blank line is the heading.  This is followed by one line
per sequence containing the following columns of data separated by one
of more space or TAB characters:

<ul>
<li>The USA (Uniform Sequence Address) that EMBOSS can use to read in the
	sequence. 
<li>The name or ID of the sequence.  If this is not known then '-' is
	output. 
<li>The accession number. If this is not known then '-' is
        output.
<li>The type ('N' is nucleic, 'P' is protein).
<li>The sequence length.
<li>The description line of the sequence. This may be blank.
</ul>

<p>

If qualifiers to inhibit various columns of information are used, then
the remaining columns of information are output in the same order as
shown above, so if '-nolength' is used, the order of output is: usa,
name, accession, type, description. 

<p>

When the -html qualifier is specified, then the output will be wrapped
in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web page.  Note that tags such as
&lt;HTML&gt; and &lt;BODY&gt; are not output by this program as the
table of databases is expected to form only part of the contents of a
web page - the rest of the web page must be supplier by the user. 

<p>

The lines of out information are guaranteed not to have trailing
white-space at the end. 

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>


None.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>


This program was written to make it easier to get some specific bits
of information on a sequence for use in small perl scripts.

This Perl code fragment to get the type of a sequence is typical:

<pre>
$type = `$PATH_TO_EMBOSS/infoseq $sequence -auto -only -type`;
chomp $type;
</pre>

<p>
You may find other uses for it, of course.
	
<p>
By default, the output file starts each line with the USA of the
sequence being described, so the output file is a list file that can be
manually edited and read in by other EMBOSS programs using the list-file
specification of '@filename'.
