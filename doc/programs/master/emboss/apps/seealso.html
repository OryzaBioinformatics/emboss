<H2>
    Description
</H2>



<p><b>seealso</b> takes the name of an EMBOSS or EMBASSY program and returns a list of applications in the same functional group.  Application names and short descriptions are listed. Optionally, the output is written to an HTML table.</p>

<p>

The result is header line 'SEE ALSO' then a simple list of program names
followed by the one-line description of the program. 

<p>

If the '-html' qualifier is used, then the result is an HTML-formatted
table, lacking the HTML document structures such as &lt;HTML&gt;,
&lt;BODY&gt;, &lt;/BODY&gt;, &lt;/HTML&gt; which the user is expected
to provide as the table will usually be included in the middle of a
larger HTML document.

    Notes
</H2>


<p>The functional group of a program is set in its ACD file; this is an EMBOSS system file which specifies the application command-line interface such as required parameters, help on the parameters, one-line description of the program and so on.  Normally the names of the groups are fairly specific.  For example "NUCLEIC COMPOSITION" is a small group of applications for nucleotide sequence composition analysis.</p>

<p>The <tt>-explode</tt> qualifier will increase the number of groups that the program retrieves by splitting the group name at selected points to produce such groups as: "NUCLEIC", "NUCLEIC COMPOSITION" and "COMPOSITION". All programs with the exploded group names which also include "NUCLEIC" and "COMPOSITION" will now be reported. The result of this qualifier is thus a report of a larger number of programs with a more tenuous link to the specified program. </p>

<p>The groups that the program belongs to can be output by using the <tt>-groups</tt> qualifier. </p>

<H2>
    References
</H2>


None.

<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

<p>The (optional) HTML-formatted table output lacks the HTML document structures such as <HTML>, <BODY>, </BODY>, </HTML>. It is expected the table will be included in the middle of a larger HTML document.</p>
