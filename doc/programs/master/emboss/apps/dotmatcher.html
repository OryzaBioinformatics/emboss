<H2>
    Description
</H2>
A dotplot is a graphical representation of the regions of similarity
between two sequences. 

<p>

The two sequences are placed on the axes of a rectangular image and
(subject to threshold conditions) wherever there is a similarity between
the sequences a dot is placed on the image. 

<p>

Where the two sequences have substantial regions of similarity, many
dots align to form diagonal lines.  It is therefore possible to see at a
glance where there are local regions of similarity as these will have
long diagonal lines.  It is also easy to see other features such as
repeats (which form parallel diagonal lines), and insertions or
deletions (which form breaks or discontinuities in the diagonal lines). 

<p>

<b>dotmatcher</b> uses a threshold to define whether a match is plotted
(calculated from the substitution matrix).  A window of specified length
is moved up all possible diagonals and a score is calculated within each
window for each position along the diagonals.  The score is the sum of
the comparisons of the two sequences using the given similarity matrix
along the window.  If the score is above the threshold, then a line is
plotted on the image over the position of the window.

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


An image is output to the requested graphics device.

<p>
<!--#include file="inc/dotmatcher.output" -->

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>


It uses the specified matrix substitution file to compare the two sequences.

<p>

For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution
matrix. For nucleotide sequence, EDNAFULL is used. Others can be
specified.
