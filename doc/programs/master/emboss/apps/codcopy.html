    Description

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
  -->

Copies a codon usage table. This program supports all available codon
usage input and output formats. Rather than a copy utility, it is
intended as a format conversion utility so that codon usage data can
be exported to other applications that support only a single format.
