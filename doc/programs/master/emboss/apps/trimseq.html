<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This program is used to tidy up the ends of sequences, removing all
the bits that you would really rather were not published.

<p>
Specifically, it:
<ul>

<li>removes all gap characters from the ends.
<li>removes X's and N's (in nucleic sequences) from the ends.
<li>optionally removes *'s from the ends
<li>optionally removes IUPAC ambiguity codes from the ends
  (B and Z in proteins, M,R,W,S,Y,K,V,H,D and B in nucleic sequences)
</ul>
<p>
It then optionally trims off poor quality regions from the end, using
a threshold percentage of unwanted characters in a window which is moved
along the sequence from the ends. The unwanted characters which are used
are X's and N's (in nucleic sequences), optionally *'s, and optionally
IUPAC ambiguity codes.

<p>
The program stops trimming the ends when the percentage of
unwanted characters in the moving window drops below the
threshold percentage. 
	
<p>
Thus if the window size is set to 1 and the percentage threshold
is 100, no further poor quality regions will be removed.
If the window size is set to 5 and the percentage threshold is 40
then the sequence  AAGCTNNNNATT   will be trimmed to AAGCT,
while AAGCTNATT or AAGCTNNNNATTT will not be trimmed as less than
40% of the last 5 characters are N's.

<p>
After trimming these poor quality regions, it will again then
trim off any dangling gap characters from the ends .

None.
	
<H2>
    Notes
</H2>


If you use the '-star' qualifier and set the window size to greater
than 1, you may trim bits of sequence with internal *'s. This may
not be what you expected.
