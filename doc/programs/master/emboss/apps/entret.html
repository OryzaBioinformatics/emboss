<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>entret</b> reads a sequence from a database or a file and writes the
complete sequence entry to a text file.
<p>

The difference between <b>entret</b> and such programs as <a
href="seqret.html">seqret</a> which also read entries from databases or
files and write them to files, is that <b>entret</b> reads and writes
the complete sequence entry together with the heading annotation
(documentation) <i>without attempting to reformat or interpret the data
in any way</i>.  <b>seqret</b> on the other hand will read in the entry
data, determine which bit of it is the sequence, which is the
description line and which is the feature table and will then write the
sequence, description and features out in the way prescribed by the
sequence format which has been requested for output. 

<p>


<b>entret</b> therefore is very useful for looking at the annotation of
sequences from databases, which <a href="seqret.html">seqret</a> does
not provide. 

<p>

The other main difference is that when it writes out the sequence entry
to a file, the information is treated as text, not sequence, and so
options that you would normally use to change the aspects of the
sequence to be written will either not be recognised and will cause an
error message to be written (e.g.  '-osformat') or will be quietly
ignored (e.g.  '-sbegin', '-send'). 


<p>

In previous versions of EMBOSS, <b>entret</b> didn't return the sequence
from entries held in GCG indexed databases.  This has now been fixed. 
<b>entret</b> will now return the complete sequence entries with the
annotation of GCG indexed databases.
