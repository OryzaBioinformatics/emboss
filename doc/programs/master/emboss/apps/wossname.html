<!--#include file="inc/wossname.ione" -->


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This allows a user to search for keywords or parts of words in the
brief documentation (as displayed by a program when it first starts).
The program name and the brief description is output.  If no words to
search for are specified, then details of all the EMBOSS programs are
output.

<p>

The program has been written on the assumption that most people will
use it to quickly find the name of a program based on that program's
description, so the output goes to the screen by default.

<p>

This program may find some use in automatically generating lists of
EMBOSS programs and their groups for Web pages.

    Input file format
</H2>


<!--#include file="inc/wossname.input" -->

<p>

<b>wossname</b> reads the brief descriptions and the program groups from
the ACD files.  (ACD files control the parameters that the programs
expect - don't worry about them unless you are writing EMBOSS
programs).

<p>

The format of ACD files is documented elsewhere.

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


The results are written out as a simple list preceded by the group
that the programs belong to or the word that is being searched for. 

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/wossname.output" -->


<p>

If the -html, -prelink and -postlink qualifiers are specified, then
the output will be wrapped in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web
page.  Note that tags such as &lt;HTML&gt;, &lt;BODY&gt;,
&lt;/BODY&gt; and &lt;/HTML&gt; are not output by this program as the
list of programs is expected to form only part of the contents of a
web page - the rest of the web page must be supplied by the user.

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>


As noted above, the program ACD files are searched.
The average user will not need to worry about this.


<H2>
    Notes
</H2>


If a program's ACD file does not assign the program to a group,
it will be automatically assigned to the group 'ASSORTED'.

<p>

A program can belong to more than one group.

<p>

The name of this program comes from its use as a favorite word of the
author Terry Pratchett.  It is used especially by the characters of the
parrot in <b>Eric</b> and the dog <i>Gaspode</i> in <b>Moving
Pictures</b> and <b>Men at Arms</b>.
