<H2>
    Description
</H2>


In EMBOSS, when an application has to write out many sequences, the
normal style is to write them all into one file containing multiple
sequences. 

<p>
This default behaviour can be changed by using the qualifier '-ossingle'
which writes many sequences into many files, each containing one
sequence.  

<p>

The program <a href="seqretsplit.html">seqretsplit</a> will take a file
containing many sequences and will output many files, each containing
one sequence.  However you have no choice over the naming of the files -
they are named after the ID name fo the sequence they contain. 

<p>

If, however you have the situation where you have a file containing
multiple sequences and you wish to extract one of them, then this
application may be useful. 

<p>

<b>nthseq</b> allows you to specify the name of the output file, so you
may find that it is useful to include this program in scripts where you
need to be able to specify the name of the resulting sequence files you
create. 

<p>

This application extracts the indicated sequence from a multiple set of
sequences and writes it out.

    Usage
</H2>


<!--#include file="inc/nthseq.usage" -->


<H2>
    Command line arguments
</H2>
<table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=3 BGCOLOR="#f5f5ff" ><tr><td>
<pre>
<!--#include file="inc/nthseq.ihelp" -->

</td></tr></table>
<P>

<!--#include file="inc/nthseq.itable" -->


<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<b>nthseq</b> reads a a normal sequence USA.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/nthseq.input" -->

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


The output is the specified ordinal sequence from the input USA.

<p>

In the example, the second sequence from the input file will be written
out to the specified output file. 

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/nthseq.output" -->


<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

None.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>


It may be useful to use this application in a small script that extracts
all sequences from a multiple sequence file and explicitly names the
output files in the way that you require. 

<p>
For example:

<p>

<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
if ($#ARGV !=1) {
  die "Usage: scriptname in out\n";
}
$count=1;
@list = `infoseq $ARGV[0] -auto -only -name`;
while ($count &lt;= $#list+1) {
  system("nthseq -auto $ARGV[0] -n $count $ARGV[1]-$count.seq");
  $count++;
}
</pre>

<H2>
