<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This program changes a sequence a lot or a little, attempting to emulate
various forms of mutation.  You can set the number and types of mutations.

<p>
It can act on the following sizes of sequence:

<ul>
<li>Point (single base or residue change)
<li>Codon (not applicable in proteins)
<li>Block of sequence (of a specified minimum and maximum random size)
</ul>

<p>
If the sequence is nucleic, the codon and block-sized operations can
optionally be done in-frame.  This causes the minimum block size to be
set to 3 and the randomly chosen positions to be multiples of 3. 

<p>
For each of the above size of sequence it can produce the effects of any
of the following types of mutation at a randomly chosen position:

<ul>
<li>Insertion of a randomly generated sequence
<li>Deletion
<li>Change (deletion then insertion of a random sequence of the same size)
<li>Duplication at an adjacent position
<li>Move region from one position to another (without deletion of the original)
<li>Any of the above, chosen at random.
<li>None of the above
</ul>

<p>
The input and output sequences may not differ if only a few changes are
chosen as (for example) one in four nucleic acid point substitutions
will not change the sequence. 

<p>
N.B.  There is no selection of the types of mutation to produce viable
sequence as there would be in a real organism.  In particular, there is
no attempt to bias mutations of nucleic acid sequences to conform to the
C+G ratio in the sequence or to bias the codons in the direction of the
frequencies used in the organism.  This program emulates mutation, not
selection. 

<p>
This program was named from the acronym of "Mutate Sequence Beyond All
Recognition", by analogy with the acronym "fubar" commonly used in the
US and UK armed forces.
