<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<p>This program changes a sequence, attempting to emulate various forms of mutation. It reads one or more sequences and writes an output file with with a set of (mutated) sequences.  The number, size and type of mutation may be specified.</p>

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<b>msbar</b> reads any sequence USA.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/msbar.input" -->

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


<!--#include file="inc/msbar.output" -->

<p>

The output is a sequence file with 5 substitutions relative to the
original sequence.

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

None.

    Notes
</H2>
<p>The qualifiers allow the number, size and type of mutation to be controlled.</p>

<p>The "size" of mutation may be set as following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Point (single base or residue change)
<li>Codon (not applicable in proteins)
<li>Block of sequence (of a specified minimum and maximum random size)
</ul>

<p>If the sequence is nucleic, the codon and block-sized operations can optionally be done in-frame. This causes the minimum block size to be set to 3 and the randomly chosen positions to be multiples of 3.</p>

<p>For each of the above size of sequence it can produce the effects of any of the following types of mutation at a randomly chosen position:</p>


<ul>
<li>Insertion of a randomly generated sequence
<li>Deletion
<li>Change (deletion then insertion of a random sequence of the same size)
<li>Duplication at an adjacent position
<li>Move region from one position to another (without deletion of the original)
<li>Any of the above, chosen at random.
<li>None of the above
</ul>


<p>The input and output sequences may not differ if only a few changes are chosen as (for example) one in four nucleic acid point substitutions will not change the sequence.</p>

<p>There is no selection of the types of mutation to produce viable sequence as there would be in a real organism. In particular, there is no attempt to bias mutations of nucleic acid sequences to conform to the C+G ratio in the sequence or to bias the codons in the direction of the frequencies used in the organism. This program emulates mutation, not selection.</p>

<p>This program was named from the acronym of "Mutate Sequence Beyond All Recognition", by analogy with the acronym "fubar" commonly used in the US and UK armed forces. </p>

<p>If you require the mutated sequences to not match some other set of sequences, this set may be specified with the -othersequence qualifier. For example, the mutants should not match the input sequence, or the results of a previous run of this program. <b>msbar</b> ensures the mutants do not match the specified sequences. If a match is found, then the mutation is started again with a fresh copy of the input sequence. If, after 10 such retries, there is still a match to the set of sequence given here, then the matching mutated sequence is written with a warning message.</p>
