<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This writes out a simple table displaying the names, contents and
available ways of accessing the sequence databases.

<p>
The available ways of accessing the databases are 'ID', 'Query' and
'All'.  These refer to the way that you can search the databases to
get entries from them, which is governed by the ways the database has
been set up and the way it is organised and indexed.

<p>
Different databases may have different access capabilities, depending
on how your local site is organised.

<p>
EMBOSS has been designed to be extremely flexible in its use of
sequence databases formats, so that it is easy to set EMBOSS up to use
your site's existing databases.  Sometimes this means that it is hard
to extract entries from some databases in particular ways.  For
example, a flat file database with no index is only useful for reading
all entries, while a database located in another site that is
available via the WWW may only provide single entries.

<p>
'ID' (also known as 'single entry') allows the programs to extract a
single explicitly named entry from the database, for example
embl:x13776

<p>
'Query' (also known as 'wild') indicates that programs can extract a
set of matching wildcard entry names (this may be slow for some
methods of access).  For example you can look at all of the human PAX
proteins in SWISS_PROT by: swissprot:pax*_human

<p>
'All' allows the programs to analyse all the entries in the database
sequentially.  For example this lets you look at all entries in the
database with the notation: embl:*

<p>
A database may have several different methods of access available.
Ideally all of the databases available on your site will be available
in all three ways, but this is not the best of all posssible worlds
and so you might like to check how you can access the databases by
running this program and having a look.

    Usage

<!--#include file="inc/showdb.usage" -->


<H2>
    Command line arguments
</H2>
<table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=3 BGCOLOR="#f5f5ff" ><tr><td>
<pre>
<!--#include file="inc/showdb.ihelp" -->

</td></tr></table>
<P>

<!--#include file="inc/showdb.itable" -->


<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

    None.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/showdb.input" -->

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


<!--#include file="inc/showdb.output" -->

<p>

The output is a simple table.

<p>

Type 'P' indicates that this is a Protein database.

<p>

Type 'N' indicates that this is a Nucleic database.

<p>

'OK' under ID, Qry or All indicates that that access method can be
used on this database.  A '-' indicates that you cannot access this
database in that way.

<p>

Note that 'OK' does not mean that the database is working correctly.  It
simply means that <b>showdb</b> has read the database definition
correctly and that this method of access to the database should be
possible. 

<p>

If you are setting up a new database, then you should check that it
works correctly by extracting entries from it using <b>seqret</b>. 

<p>

When the -html qualifier is specified, then the output will be wrapped
in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web page.  Note that tags such
as &lt;HTML&gt;, &lt;BODY&gt;, &lt;/BODY&gt; and &lt;/HTML&gt; are not
output by this program as the table of databases is expected to form
only part of the contents of a web page - the rest of the web page
must be supplied by the user.


<H2>
    Data files
</H2>


The databases are specified in the files <i>"emboss.defaults"</i> for
site wide definitions, and <i>"~/.embossrc"</i> for the user's own
settings.
	
<H2>
    Notes
</H2>


Note that 'OK' in the output does not mean that the database is working
correctly.  It simply means that <b>showdb</b> has read the database
definition correctly and that this method of access to the database
should be possible. 

<p>

If you are setting up a new database, then you should check that it
works correctly by extracting entries from it using <b>seqret</b>. 

<p>

You can set up your own private databases by editing a file called
'.embossrc' to contain database specifications. 

<p>

You can set up public databases by editing the file
'/usr/local/share/EMBOSS/emboss.default' (if you have the permission to
do this). 

<p>

The 'emboss.default' file will already have the definitions of the test
databases in: tsw, tembl, tpir, etc.  These are the databases that are
used in the examples shown in the documentation of the programs. 

<p>

For details of the database definitions, you should first read David's
Administration Guide:
<a href="/docs/adminguide/">
http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/adminguide/
</a>
especially:
<a href="/docs/adminguide/node4.html">
http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/adminguide/adminguide/node4.html
</a>

<p>

See also:
<a href="/docs/themes/Databases.html">
http://emboss.sourceforge.net/docs/themes/Databases.html
</a>
for a lot of detail of the syntax of database definition.

<p>

Just because showdb can display the database definitions, it does NOT
mean that the databases are set up correctly.  You must now test them
using <b>seqret</b>.

"The database 'xyz' does not exist" You have supplied the name of a
database with the -database qualifier, but that database does not
exist as far as EMBOSS is concerned.

<H2>
    Exit status
</H2>


It always exits with status 0, unless the above diagnostic message is
displayed.
