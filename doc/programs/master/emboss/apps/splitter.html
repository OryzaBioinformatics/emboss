<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This simple editing program allows you to split a long sequence
into smaller, optionally overlapping, subsequences. 

<p>



There should be little requirement to split sequences into smaller
sub-sequences in EMBOSS, but there may be circumstances where memory
usage becomes restrictive when dealing with truly large sequences.  In
this case, memory usage may be reduced by repeating the analysis several
times on split sub-sequences. 

<p>

If you need to split a large sequence into smaller subsequences so that
a non-EMBOSS program can analyse the smaller sequence, it may also be
useful to write the sub-sequences into separate files instead of the
default EMBOSS behaviour of concatenating them together into one file. 

<p>

To write the output sequences to separate files, use the command-line
switch '-ossingle'.

<H2>
    Input File Format
</H2>


<b>splitter</b>	reads one or more sequence USAs.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/splitter.input" -->

<H2>
    Output File Format
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/splitter.output" -->


<p>
The names of the sequences are the same as the original sequence, with
'_start-end' appended, where 'start', and 'end' are the start and end
positions of the sub-sequence. eg: The name HSHBB would be changed in
the sub-sequences to: HSHBB_1-50000 and HSHBB_50001-73308 if they were
split at the size of 50000 with no overlap.
