<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<p><b>splitter</b> splits one or more input sequences into smaller, optionally overlapping, subsequences. The subsequence size and overlap (if any) may be specified. Optionally, feature information will be used.</p>

    Output File Format
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/splitter.output" -->


<p>
The names of the sequences are the same as the original sequence, with
'_start-end' appended, where 'start', and 'end' are the start and end
positions of the sub-sequence. eg: The name U01317 would be changed in
the sub-sequences to: U01317_1-50000 and U01317_50001-73308 if they were
split at the size of 50000 with no overlap.

None.	

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<p>Splitting a large sequence into smaller sub-sequences for analysis might be useful in cases where a particularly memory or CPU intensive application will not run quickly enough or at all on the full sequence.  This should seldom be necessary in EMBOSS.</p>

<p>By default, <b>splitter</b> will write all the sub-sequences to a single file. In some cases, particularly where non-EMBOSS programs are used, it is necessary to have a single sequence per file.  To write the sub-sequences into separate files use the command-line switch <tt>-ossingle</tt>.</p>
