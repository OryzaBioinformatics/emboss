<H2>
    Description
</H2>

This is an implementation of the original Garnier Osguthorpe Robson
algorithm (GOR I) for predicting protein secondary structure.

<p>

Secondary structure prediction is notoriously difficult to do accurately.
The GOR I alogorithm is one of the first semi-successful methods.

<p>

The Garnier method is not regarded as the most accurate prediction, but
is simple to calculate on most workstations.

<p>

The accuracy of any secondary structure prediction program is not much
better than 70% to 80% at best.  This is an early algorithm and will
probably not predict with much better than about 65% accuracy. 

<p>

The Web servers for PHD, DSC, and others are generally preferred.

The meaning and use of the parameter 'idc' is currently being
investigated.  The original author, Bill Pearson writes:

<p>
<i>"In their paper, GOR mention that if you know something about the
secondary structure content of the protein you are analyzing, you can do
better in prediction.  "idc" is an index into a set of arrays, dharr[]
and dsarr[], which provide "decision constants" (dch, dcs), which are
offsets that are applied to the weights for the helix and sheet (extend)
terms.  So, idc=0 says don't use the decision constant offsets, and
idc=1 to 6 indicates that various combinations of dch,dcs offsets should
be used.  I don't remember what they are, but I must have gotten the
values from their paper."</i>

The 3D structure for the example sequence is known, although the
2D structure elements were not in the SwissProt feature table for
release 38 when the test data was extracted.

You are advised to use several of the latest Web-based prediction sites
and combine them to make a consensus prediction.
