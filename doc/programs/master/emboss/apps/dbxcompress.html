<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>dbxcompress</b> compressed EMBOSS B+tree format index files. By
default, the indexing applications in EMBOSS compress all index
files.

<p>
Indexes modified by <b>dbxuncompress</b> and indexes prior to
EMBOSS 6.4.0 are uncompressed.


<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

The B+tree index files contain discrete pages with a known maximum
size, filled from the first byte with a count of index terms.

<p>
<b>dbxcompress</b> reads all pages, calculating the free space at the
end of each page, and then rewrite the pages to disk removing all free space.

<p>
The final page is always written in full. This allows index reading to
assume the maximum page size in all cases without reading beyond the
end of file.

<p>
Uncompressed index files are required for updating an existing
index. Compressed index files provide more efficient storage and
retrieval.

<b>dbxcompress</b> reads the index files for a database created with
an older version of one of the 'dbx' indexing programs, or
uncompressed with <b>dbxuncompress</b>.
