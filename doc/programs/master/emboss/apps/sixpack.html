<b>sixpack</b> takes a nucleic acid sequence and writes out the forward
and reverse senses of the sequence with the 3 forward and three reverse
translations in a pretty display format. 

<p>

It also writes a file containing the open reading frames that are larger
than the specified minimum size (default 1 base, showing all possible
open reading frames).  These open reading frames are written as protein
sequences in the default output sequence format. 

<p>

An open reading frame is defined in this program as any possible
translation between two STOP codons. 

<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

The nucleic acid sequence is read in.
<br>
The required genetic code is read in from the EGC* data files.
<br>
The three forward and three reverse translations are created.
<br>
The name and description are written to the ouput display file.
<br>
Any required regions to be changed to upper case are changed.
<br>
Any required regions to be highlighted in HTML colour tags are changed.
<br>
The reverse sense sequence is placed below the forward sequence.
<br>
The forward translations are placed above the sequences.
<br>
The reverse translation are placed below the sequences.
<br>
The display is written out, split at the ends of lines.
<br>
Any ORFs that are longer than the specified minimum size are written to
the output sequence file.
