<H2>
    Function
</H2>
<!--#include file="inc/acdpretty.ione" -->

<H2>
    Description
</H2>
<p><b>acdpretty</b> will generate a correctly, fully formatted ACD file from one which is parsable but which is partly or incorrectly formatted.</p>

<p><b>acdpretty</b> reads the ACD file and rewrites it with clean formatting to the file (<tt>ApplicationName</tt>).<b>acdpretty</b> which can be used to overwrite the original ACD file.  The new file might contain many differences.  For example, abbreviations will be expanded, all sections and attributes will be indented, all values will be quoted and lines will be wrapped at a reasonable width.  



<H2>
    Usage
</H2>
<!--#include file="inc/acdpretty.usage" -->

<H2>
    Command line arguments
</H2>


The first parameter is the name of the program to pretty print.

<p>
All other command line parameters and qualifiers are essentially
ignored as processing stops once the ACD file is printed. A few of the
general qualifiers have the potential to conflict with the function of
acdpretty..

<P>


<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>


The input file is the ACD file for the specified program

<p>
<!--#include file="inc/acdpretty.input" -->


<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<p>

The output file is a pretty printed copy of the original ACD file.

<p>
All sections and attributed will be indented. All values will be
quoted. Lines will be wrapped at a reasonable width.

<p>
The output file is intended as a standard format for parsers used by
GUI and other interface wrappers, rather than using the original ACD
file directly.

None

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>
<p><b>acdpretty</b> does not have its own options, but takes a single parameter which is the name of the ACD file that is being processed.  It is invoked by specifying the name of the ACD file after the name of the utility application itself:</p>

<p><tt><b>acdpretty</b> ApplicationName</tt></p>

<p>Any command line parameters that would normally be specified for the application are essentially ignored as processing stops once the reformatted ACD file is printed.</p> 

<p>The format generated by <b>acdpretty</b> is intended as a standard for parsers used by GUI and other interface developers. It is far easier writing a parser to cope with <b>acdpretty</b> output than one which can cope with the ACD sytax in general.</p>
