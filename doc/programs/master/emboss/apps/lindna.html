<H2>
    Description
</H2>


The program 'lindna' draws linear maps of DNA constructs.

<p>
It uses the graphical shapes: ticks, ranges, and blocks to
represent genetic markers (e.g, genes and ESTs) and places them
according to their position in a DNA fragment.  The markers can be
organized in different groups. 

<p>
The program reads in one input file in which the user specifies the
names and positions of the genetic markers.  In this file the user also
enters data for controlling the appearance of the markers. 

<p>
A refined customization of the drawing can be achieved by running the
program with '-options' on the command line and changing the values of
the desired parameters.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/lindna.input" -->


<p>

Blank lines in the input file are ignored. 

<p>

The file is organized in several fields separated by one or more space
or TAB characters.

<p>

The first non-blank line gives the start position of the DNA fragment to
be drawn after the keyword 'Start'.  The end position is on the second
line following the keyword 'End'. 

<p>

Then, one or more groups (up to a maximum of 20) of genetic markers are
defined.  Each group begins with a line consisting of the keyword
'group' and ends with a line consisting of the keyword 'endgroup'. 

<p>

If desired, a group name can be given on the very next line. Spaces 
and tabulations are allowed but only the first 20 characters of that name 
(including spaces) will be displayed. 

<p>

Next, the individual markers (up to a maximum of 1000) of the group are
described.  Each marker begins with a line consisting of the keyword
'label' and ends with a line consisting of the keyword 'endlabel'.

<p>

Do not start a new marker (by using a 'label' line) before you have
closed the previous marker (by using an 'endlabel' line).  You must end
a previous marker specification before starting a new one.  i.e.  do not
overlap marker specifications in the input file. 

<p>

For each marker, the line following the 'label' line describes the
marker. Three types of markers can be drawn: ticks, blocks, and ranges. 

<p>

For a tick, the descriptive line begins with the keyword 'Tick',
followed by the position of the tick in the DNA fragment, and a number
from 0 to 15 specifying the color in which the tick will be drawn (a
list of available colors is given below).  If desired, one or more names
can be written above the tick.  In this case an optional letter H or V
should be added to the line.  H or V indicate whether the text will be
horizontal or vertical, respectively.  If no letter is specified, H is
assumed by default.  A list of one or more names can be given on the
next lines with one name per line. 

<p>

For a block, the descriptive line begins with the keyword 'Block',
followed by the start and end positions of the block in the DNA
fragment, and the number of the block's color.  If desired, one or more
names can be written above the block.  Names are given on the following
lines.  An optional letter H or V can be added to the end of the
descriptive line to specify the orientation of the name(s). 

<p>

For a range, the descriptive line begins with the keyword 'Range',
followed by the start and end positions of the range in the DNA
fragment.  Next on the line are the types of boundaries that are to be
drawn.  The user can choose among '&gt;', '&lt;', '[', ']' and '|' for
both start and end boundaries.  If none of these types is wanted for a
given boundary, then a point '.' must be entered.  Next is the color
number.  If desired, one or more names can be written above the range. 
Names are given on the following lines.  An optional letter H or V can
be added to the end of the descriptive line to specify the orientation
of the name(s). 

<p>

For any type of markers, names will be written in the same color as the
marker.  Also, try to avoid long names. 

<p>

The colors defined in the PLPLOT graphics library are:

<p>

0 "BLACK", 1 "RED", 2 "YELLOW", 3 "GREEN", 4 "AQUAMARINE",
5 "PINK", 6 "WHEAT", 7 "GREY", 8 "BROWN", 9 "BLUE", 10 "BLUEVIOLET",
11 "CYAN", 12 "TURQUOISE", 13 "MAGENTA", 14 "SALMON", and 15 "WHITE".

<p>

This format can also be used for the program <a
