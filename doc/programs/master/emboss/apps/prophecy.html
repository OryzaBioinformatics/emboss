<H2>
    Function
</H2>
<!--#include file="inc/prophecy.ione" -->


<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<p>prophecy generates for an input sequence alignment a simple frequency matrix (for use by profit) or a position specific weighted profile using either the Gribskov (1) or Henikoff (2) method (for use by prophet). For constructing a simple frequency matrix, a residue substitution matrix, gap opening and gap extension penalty must be specified.</p>



<h2>Algorithm</h2>

<p>The Gribskov scoring scheme is based on a notion of distance between a sequence and an ancestral or generalized sequence. For Henikoff it is based on weights of the diversity observed at each position in the alignment, rather than on a sequence distance measure.</p>

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<b>prophecy</b> reads a protein or a nucleic sequence alignment USA.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/prophecy.input" -->


<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

The output is a profile file.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/prophecy.output" -->

<p>

<h3>Simple frequency matrix</h3>

<p>

The columns represent amino acid counts for the amino acid residues from
A to Z.  The rows represent the alignment positions from 1->n.  The file
is a "Simple" frequency matrix of "Length" 20 amino acids.  The maximum
score this matrix can give is 496.  The "Threshold" value is an
instruction to the <b>profit</b> application to only report matches
above the given score. 

<p>

<h3>Gribskov profile</h3>

<p>

The columns represent the amino acids from A to Z, the rows denote the
alignment position from 1 to n.  The last column is the indel penalty. 
The "Name" is the name used by <b>prophet</b> to refer to the profile,
the "Matrix" is the name of the scoring matrix used (containing residue
substitution values).  "Length" is the length of the alignment. 
"Max_score" is the maximum score this profile can produce.  The
threshold is an instruction to <b>prophet</b> to only report hits equal
to or above the given value.  The gap opening and extension values are
used by <b>prophet</b> in the dynamic alignment (Smith Waterman
equivalent). 


<H2>
    Data files
</H2>


The two profile methods require a residue substitution scoring
matrix.

<p>

The Gribskov marices use the data file 'Epprofile' by default.  This is
derived from a PAM250 scoring matrix. 

<p>

The Henikoff matrices use the data file 'EBLOSUM62' by default.

    Notes
</H2>

<p>Profile analysis is a method for detecting distantly related proteins by sequence comparison. The basis for comparison is not only the customary Dayhoff mutational-distance matrix but also the results of structural studies and information implicit in the alignments of the sequences of families of similar proteins. This information is expressed in a position-specific scoring table (profile), which is created from a group of sequences previously aligned by structural or sequence similarity. The similarity of any other target sequence to the group of aligned probe sequences can be tested by comparing the target to the profile using dynamic programming algorithms. The profile method differs in two major respects from methods of sequence comparison in common use: (i) Any number of known sequences can be used to construct the profile, allowing more information to be used in the testing of the target than is possible with pairwise alignment methods. (ii) The profile includes the penalties for insertion or deletion at each position, which allow one to include the probe secondary structure in the testing scheme.</p>
