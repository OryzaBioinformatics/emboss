    Function
</H2>
<!--#include file="inc/trimest.ione" -->

<H2>
    Description
</H2>

EST and mRNA sequences often have poly-A tails at the end of them.  This
utility removes those poly-A tails. 

<p>

EST sequences are often the reverse complement of the corresponding
mRNA's forward sense and have poly-T tails at their 5' end.  By default,
this program also detects and removes these and writes out the reverse
complement of the sequence. 

<p>

<b>trimest</b> is not infallible.  There are often repeats of 'A' (or
'T') in a sequence that just happen by chance to occur at the 3' (or 5')
end of the EST sequence.  <b>trimest</b> has no way of determining if the
A's it finds are part of a real poly-A tail or are a part of the
transcribed genomic sequence.  It removes any apparent poly-A tails that
match its criteria for a poly-A tail. 

<p>

<b>trimest</b> looks for a repeat of at least '-minlength' A's at the 3'
end (and, by default, '-minlength' T's at the 5' end).  If there are an
apparent 5' poly-T tail and a poly-A tail, then it removes whichever is
the longer of the two. 

<p>

By default, it will allow '-mismatches' non-A (or non-T) bases in the
tail.  If a mismatch is found, then there has to be at least
'-minlength' A's (or T's) past the mismatch (working from the end) for
the mismatch to be considered part of the tail.  If '-mismatches' is
greater than 1 then that number of contiguous non-A (or non-T) bases
will be allowed as part of the tail. 

<p>

If a 5' poly-T tail is found, then the sequence will be optionally
reverse-complemented when it is written out. 

<p>

If a poly-A tail is reomved then '[poly-A tail removed]' is appended to
the description of the sequence.  If poly-T is removed, then '[poly-T
tail removed]' is appended and if the sequence is reversed, '[reverse
complement]' is appended.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<b>trimest</b> reads the USA of one or more normal nucleic acid sequences.

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!--#include file="inc/trimest.output" -->

<p>

The output is a set of sequences with the poly-A (or poly-T) tails
removed.  If a sequence had a 5' poly-T tail then the resulting sequence
is reverse-complemented by default.  The description line has a comment
appended about the changes made to the sequence.

    Warnings
</H2>

It will trim any run of more than -minlength A's or T's at the 3' or 5'
end, whether or not they are a true poly-A tail.
