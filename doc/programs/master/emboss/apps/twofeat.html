<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>twofeat</b> reads in the feature tables of sequences and reports
occurances of pairs of specified features. 

<p>

This is intended for use as a simple data-mining tool to enable you to
look for instances of pairs of features that occur near to each other in
the same sequence entry. 

<p>

For each of the pair of features, you can specify its type name, its
sense, its score and any tag/value pairs, amongst other things. 

<p>

You can then specify the type of relationship that the two features
should have.  You can specify the minimum and maximum distance between
them.  You can specify the type of overlap allowed: Any type of overlap
or no overlap is allowed, Overlap required, No overlaps are allowed,
Overlap required but one feature must not be completely within the
other, Feature A must be completely enclosed within feature B, Feature B
must be completely enclosed within feature A.  You can specify that the
distance should be measured from the nearest ends of the two features,
From the left ends, From right ends, From the furthest ends.  You can
specify that the features should be in any sense, in the same sense or
in opposite senses.  You can specify that the features should be in any
order, Feature A then feature B, Feature B then feature A. 

<p>

By default the resulting pairs of features found are then written to a
report file as a single feature from the first postion of the left-most
feature to the last position of the right-most feature.  You can modify
the output to report the pairs of features with no changes made to them. 

<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

<pre>
For each sequence:
	identify the features that match the criteria for Feature A
	identify the features that match the criteria for Feature B
	compare all pairs of features
	if they satisfy the requirements output them to the report file
</pre>
