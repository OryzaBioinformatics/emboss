</H2>
<!--#include file="inc/restrict.ione" -->


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


Restrict uses the REBASE database of restriction enzymes to predict
cut sites in a DNA sequence. The program allows you to select a range
of cuts, whether the DNA is circular, whether IUB ambiguity codes are
used, whether blunt or sticky ends or both are reported. You may also
force the reporting of single cleavage sites.

<p>

By default, only one of any group of isoschizomers (enzymes that have
the same recognition site and cut positions) is reported (this
behaviour can be turned off by setting the qualifier '-limit' to be
false.) The reported enzyme from any one group of isoschizomers (the
prototype) is specified in the REBASE database and the information is
held in the data file 'embossre.equ'.  You may edit this file to set
your own preferred prototype,if you wish.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>


<b>restrict</b> reads one or more DNA sequence USAs.

<p>

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


<!--#include file="inc/reportformats.ihtml" -->

<p>

By default <b>restrict</b> writes a 'table' report file.

<p>

<!--#include file="inc/restrict.output" -->

<p>

The output from restrict is a simple text one. The base number,
restriction enzyme name, recognition site and cut positions are
shown. Note that cuts are always to the right of the residue
shown and that 5' cuts are referred to by their associated 3'
number sequence.

<p>

The program reports enzymes that cut at two or four sites. The
program also reports isoschizomers and enzymes having the same
recognition sequence but different cut sites.


<p>

When the "-fragments" or "-solofragments" qualifiers are given then the sizes of
the fragments produced by either all of the specified enzymes cutting, or
by each enzyme cutting individually, are given in the 'tail' section
at the end of the report file.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>


Output file size is related to the size of the recognition site and the
maximum number of allowed cutting positions. Setting the site length
to six and restricting the cuts to two is a common choice of parameters.
The size of the output can sometimes be reduced by specifying
the -noambiguity switch.
<p>

The data files must have been created before running this
program. This is done by running the <b>rebaseextract</b> program with
the "withrefm" and "prot" files from an REBASE release. You may have
to ask your system manager to do this.
