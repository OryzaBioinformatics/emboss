Description
</H2>

<b>etandem</b> looks for tandem repeats in a sequence. It is normally
used after equicktandem has been run to identify potential repeat
sizes.  It calculates a consensus for the repeat region and gives a
score for how many matches there are to the consensus - the number of
mismatches.

<p>

Input sequences are converted into ACGT or N (so ambiguity codes are ignored).
<br>
The score is +1 for a match, -1 for a mismatch.
<br>
The first copy of a repeat is ignored.
<br>
The highest score is kept for each start position and repeat size.

<p>

The lowest score to be reported is set by the threshold score.  The
threshold score can be set on the command-line using the
<b>-threshold</b> qualifier, the default is 20.  For perfect repeats, the
score is the length of the repeat (except for the first copy).  Reduce
the threshold score a little if you wish to to allow mismatches.  Each
mismatch scores -1 instead of +1 so it scores 2 less than a perfect
match of the same number of bases. 

<p>

Running with a wide range of repeat sizes is inefficient. That is why
equicktandem was written - to give a rapid estimate of the major repeat
sizes.
