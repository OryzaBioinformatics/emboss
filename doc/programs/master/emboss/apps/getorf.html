<H2>
    Description
</H2>
<p>This program finds and outputs the sequences of open reading frames (ORFs) in one or more nucleotide sequences.  An ORF may be defined as a region of a specified minimum size between two STOP codons, or between a START and a STOP codon.  The ORFs can be output as the nucleotide sequence or as the protein translation. Optionally, the program will output the region around the START codon, the first STOP codon, or the final STOP codon of an ORF. The START and STOP codons are defined in a Genetic Code table; a suitable table can be selected for the organism you are investigating. The output is a sequence file containing predicted open reading frames longer than the minimum size, which defaults to 30 bases (i.e. 10 amino acids).</p>

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>


<b>getorf</b> reads any nucleic acid sequence USA.

<p>
<!--#include file="inc/getorf.input" -->


<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


The output is a sequence file containing predicted open reading frames
longer than the minimum size, which defaults to 30 bases (i.e. 10 amino acids).

<p>
<!--#include file="inc/getorf.output" -->

<p> 

The name of the ORF sequences is constructed from the name of the
input sequence with an underscore character ('_') and a unique ordinal number
of the ORF found appended.  The description of the output ORF sequence
is constructed from the description of the input sequence with the start
and end positions of the ORF prepended.  

<p>

The unique number appended to the name is simply used to create new
unique sequence names, it does not imply any further information
indicating any order, positioning or sense-strand of the ORFs. 

<p>

If the ORF has been found in the reverse sense, then the start position
will be smaller than the end position.  The numbering uses the
forward-sense positions, but read in the reverse sense.  For example,
<b>&gt;V00294_3 [465 - 49]</b> in the output above is a reverse-sense
ORF running from position 465 to 49.  The description will also contain
'(REVERSE SENSE)'. 

<p>

If the sequence has been specified as a circular genome (using the
command-line switch '-circular'), then ORFs can potentially continue
past the 'end' of the input sequence (the breakpoint of the circular
genome) and into the 'start' of the sequence again.  This is dealt with
by appending the sequence to itself three times and reporting long ORFs
that are found in this extended sequence.  Any ORF that is longer that
three times the sequence length (i.e one that continues without hitting
a STOP at any point in the genome) will be reported as being a maximum
of three times the length of the input sequence.  Note that the end
position of an ORF in circular genomes can be apparently longer than the
input sequence if the ORF crosses the breakpoint.  If the ORF crosses
the breakpoint, then the text '(ORF crosses the breakpoint)' will be
added to the description of the output sequence. 

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

The START and STOP codons used by <b>getorf</b> are defined in the
Genetic Code data files. By default, Genetic Code file <b>EGC.0</b>
is used.
<p>

The default file <b>EGC.0</b> is the 'Standard Code' with the rarely
used alternate START codons omitted, it only has the normal 'AUG' START
codon.  The 'Standard Code' with the rarely used alternate START codons
included is Genetic Code file <b>EGC.1</b>. 

<p>

It is expected that user will sometimes wish to customise a Genetic Code
file. To do this, use the program <b>embossdata</b>.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<p>There are two common definitions of an open reading frame: it can either be a region that is free of STOP codons or a region that begins with a START codon and ends with a STOP codon.</p>
