<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<p><B>Dan</B> calculates the melting temperature (Tm) and the
percentage of G+C nucleotides for windows over a nucleic acid
sequence, optionally plotting them.  If a plot is not being
produced, <b>dan</b> reports the sequence of each oligomer window, its
melting temperature under the specified conditions and its percentage
GC content.  The change in enthalpy (H), entropy (S) and Gibbs free
energy (S) for dissociation of the oligomers may (optionally) be
reported to file (but not plotted).</p>

<H2>
Algorithm
</H2>

<p>The values of melting point and other thermodynamic properties of
the sequence, namely change in enthalpy (H), entropy (S) and Gibbs
free energy (S) on dissociation, are calculated for a sequence region
(or "window") of a user-specified size (see "-windowsize" option).
The window is incrementally moved along the sequence with the
properties being calculated at each new position.  The user must
provide the salt and DNA concentration. Optionally, the percent
formamide, percent of mismatches allowed and product length may be
specified.
<p>For the melting temperature profile, free energy values calculated
from nearest neighbor thermodynamics are used (Breslauer et
al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 83, 3746-3750, Baldino et al. Methods
in Enzymol. 168, 761-777, Allawi and SantaLucia (1997), Biochemistry
36:10581-10594).</p>

    Command line arguments

<table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=3 BGCOLOR="#f5f5ff" ><tr><td>

<P>

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

Any DNA or RNA sequence USA. 

<p>
<!--#include file="inc/dan.input" -->


<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

If a plot is not being produced, dan reports the sequence of each
oligomer window, its melting temperature under the specified conditions
and its GC content. 

<p>
<!--#include file="inc/reportformats.ihtml" -->
<p>

By default <b>dan</b> writes a 'seqtable' report file.

<p>
<!--#include file="inc/dan.output" -->
<p>

The header information contains details of the program, date and sequence

<p>
Subsequent lines contain columns of data for each window into the
sequence as it is moved along, giving:

<p>
<ul>
<li> The start postion of the window
<li> The end position of the window
<li> The melting temperature of the window
<li> The percentage C+G of the window
<li> The sequence of the window
</ul>


<p>

If the qualifier '-product' is used to make the program prompt for
percent formamide percent of mismatches allowed and product length, then
the output includes the melting temperature of the specified product.

<p>

If the qualifier '-thermo' is gived then the DeltaG, DeltaH and DeltaS
of the sequence in the window is also output.

    Data files
</H2>


The EMBOSS data files "Edna.melt" and "Erna.melt" are used to read in the
entropy/enthalpy/energy data for DNA and RNA respectively.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<p>The enthalpy of a reaction equates to the "heat" of the reaction so
long as temperate and pressure are constant.  Enthalpy depends upon
the strength of the chemical bonds and non-bonding interactions
involved.  The entropy of a reaction reflects the level of disorder or
randomness of the molecules involved. The higher the entropy, the
greater the disorder.  The free energy of a reaction reflects it's
ability to do work.  It helps one determine whether a reaction is
feasible given a set of conditions and it's quilibrium.</p>

RNA sequences must be submited to this application with the '-rna'
qualifier on the command line, otherwise the sequence will be assumed to
be DNA.
