<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<p><b>newseq</b> creates a sequence file from a sequence that is manually typed in at the command-line. This is a quicker, easier and less error-prone method than editing such a file in a text editor.</p>

None.	

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>


The length of the sequence you can type in is restricted to a
fairly short length (typically less than 255 characters). 
If your computer beeps at you, you will typically have to delete
the last character you typed and press the RETURN key.

<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>


<p>There will be a maximum permissible length (typically 255 characters) of the sequence that may be entered. This is not a property of the EMBOSS package but of the computer system you are using. Whenever you type something in at the command-line, the text is stored in a buffer before being passed to the program.  There is often a limit of less than 255 characters on the size of the buffer and so also the size of the sequence you can specify to <b>newseq</b>. The computer will normally issue a beep when the end of buffer is reached, and allow no more character input. </p>
