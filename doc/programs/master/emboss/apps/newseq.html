<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This allows you to type a sequence into a file in a quick and
easy manner.

<p>
The length of the sequence you can type in is restricted to a
fairly short length (typically less than 255 characters).  This
length restriction is not a property of the EMBOSS package, but of the
computer system you are using.  This is because, as you type in
response to a prompt from this program, what you type is stored in the
computer operating system before being handed over to the program. 
There is often a limit of less than 255 characters on the length of a
response that a computer system will allow you to give. 

<p>
Despite this restriction, it is expected that this program will
be a useful and easy way of constructing new sequence files. 

<p>
(You wouldn't want to type a long sequence in by hand, anyway,
would you?)
