<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>digest</b> finds the positions where a specified proteolytic enzyme
or reagent might cut a peptide sequence. 

<p>

This programs allows you to input a protein sequence and to specify one
proteolytic agent from a list.  It will then output a file containing
the positions where the agent cuts, together with the peptides produced. 

<p>

Trypsin will not normally cut after a K if it is followed by (e.g.)
another K or a P.  Specifying the qualifier <b>-unfavoured</b> shows
those cuts.  as well as the favoured ones. 

<p>

If you wish to emulate a partial digestion, then using the
<b>-overlap</b> qualifier will display the results from a digest in
which all cut sites are used and in which one site at a time is not cut. 
Thus the resulting peptide fragments from the cut sites numbered 1, 2,
3, 4 etc.  are shown, plus the fragments produced by cutting at the
sites 1..3, 2..4, etc. 

<p>

i.e. fragments containing one potential cut site are also shown.

<p>

If you wish to emulate a <b>very</b> partial digestion (!) then using
the <b>-allpartials</b> qualifier will do what <b>-overlap</b> did, but
also show all possible fragments from using all possible combinations of
cut sites.  For example, fragments from the cut sites numbered 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 and from the fragments produced by cutting between sites 1..3,
1..4, 1..5, 2..4, 2..5, 3..5, etc. 

<p>

i.e. fragments containing one or more potential cut site are also shown.


<p>

If the boolean -ragging is specified then terminal break-up
fragments are also shown; this can be useful for mass spectrometry.
Ragging is further controlled by the -termini
option which allows you to select removal of residues from
the N and/or C termini.

<table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=3 BGCOLOR="#f5f5ff" ><tr><td>

<P>
<!--#include file="inc/digest.itable" -->

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

Any protein sequence.

<p>
<!--#include file="inc/digest.input" -->

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>
<!--#include file="inc/reportformats.ihtml" -->

By default <b>digest</b> writes a 'seqtable' report file.


<p>
<!--#include file="inc/digest.output" -->

<p>

The header information contains the program name, date of run, name of
the reagent used to digest the protein and the number of fragments
reported.  The header will report if complete or partial digestion was
chosen.  

<p>
The rest of the file consists of columns holding the following data:

<ul>
<li> The start position of the fragment
<li> The end position of the fragment
<li> The molecular weight of the fragment
<li> The residue before the cut site ('.' if start of sequence)
<li> The residue after the second cut site ('.' if end of sequence)
<li> The sequence of the fragment. 
</ul>
