<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>eprimer3</b> is an interface to the 'primer3' program from the
Whitehead Institute. 

<p>

The Whitehead program must be set up and on the path in order for
<b>eprimer3</b> to find and run it. 

<p>

Primer3 picks primers for PCR reactions, considering as criteria:
<p>

<UL>
<LI>oligonucleotide melting temperature, size, GC content,
  and primer-dimer possibilities,

<LI>PCR product size,

<LI>positional constraints within the source sequence, and

<LI>miscellaneous other constraints.
</UL>

<p>

All of these criteria are user-specifiable as constraints.

<p>

<b>eprimer3</b> can also pick hybridisation oligos that are internal to
the product. 


<H3>ADVICE FOR PICKING PRIMERS</H3>

We suggest referring to: Wojciech Rychlik, "Selection of Primers
for Polymerase Chain Reaction" in BA White, Ed., "Methods in
Molecular Biology, Vol. 15: PCR Protocols: Current Methods and
Applications", 1993, pp 31-40, Humana Press, Totowa NJ

<H4>Cautions</H4>

Some of the most important issues in primer picking can be
addressed only before using eprimer3.  These are sequence quality
(including making sure the sequence is not vector and not
chimeric) and avoiding repetitive elements.

<p>

Techniques for avoiding problems include a thorough understanding
of possible vector contaminants and cloning artifacts coupled
with database searches using blast, fasta, or other similarity
searching program to screen for vector contaminants and possible
repeats.  Repbase (J. Jurka, A.F.A. Smit, C. Pethiyagoda, and
others, 1995-1996, ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/repository/repbase)
is an excellent source of repeat sequences and pointers to the
literature.  eprimer3 now allows you to screen candidate oligos
against a Mispriming Library (or a Mishyb Library in the case
of internal oligos).

<p>

Sequence quality can be controlled by manual trace viewing and
quality clipping or automatic quality clipping programs.  Low-
quality bases should be changed to N's or can be made part of
Excluded Regions. The beginning of a sequencing read is often
problematic because of primer peaks, and the end of the read
often contains many low-quality or even meaningless called bases.
Therefore when picking primers from single-pass sequence it is
often best to use the INCLUDED_REGION parameter to ensure that
eprimer3 chooses primers in the high quality region of the read.

<p>

In addition, eprimer3 takes as input a Sequence Quality list for
use with those base calling programs 

<p>

(e.g. Phred, Bass/Grace, Trout) that output this information.

<H4>What to do if eprimer3 cannot find a primers?</H4>

Try relaxing various parameters, including the
self-complementarity parameters and max and min oligo melting
temperatures.  For example, for very A-T-rich regions you might
have to increase maximum primer size or decrease minimum melting
temperature.  It is usually unwise to reduce the minimum primer
size if your template is complex (e.g. a mammalian genome), since
small primers are more likely to be non-specific.  Make sure that
there are adequate stretches of non-Ns in the regions in which
you wish to pick primers.  If necessary you can also allow an N
in your primer and use an oligo mixture containing all four bases
at that position.

<p>

Try setting the '-explain' option.

    Output file format
</H2>


<!--#include file="inc/eprimer3.output" -->
<p>

If the '-explain' flag has been used, as in the example, then statistics
are output describing the number of primers that were considered and
rejected for various reasons. 

<p>

Headers describing the input file name and the names of the output
columns are displayed.

<p>

The best 5 primer pairs are displayed with the product size.

<p>

The reverse sequence is displayed as the reverse complement to the input
forward sense sequence. 

<p>

The 'Start' positions are given counting from the start of the sequence
for both the forward and reverse primer (and for the internal oligos). 

<p>

Note that if you compare the results to the output from the public
Primer3 web site you will see a difference in the reverse primer
positions - this is because the original Primer3 program reports the
reverse primer positions as counted from the 3' end.  The convention in
EMBOSS is to report both forward and reverse features as counted from
the 5' end, so the reverse primer positions are given counted from the
5' start of the sequence.

    Notes
</H2>

The Whitehead Institute's primer3 program is not part of this program,
but it must be set up on your system and on your path. 

<p>
The Whitehead Institute program that is run by this program is available from:
http://primer3.sourceforge.net/
<br>
(Then see the link Download and then 'Release 1.1.4')
<p>

Earlier versions are also supported. We expect later versions to also
work - please contact the EMBOSS team if you find any problems.
