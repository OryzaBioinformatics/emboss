<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<p><b>patmatdb</b> searches the input protein sequences for the specified sequence motif.  The output is a standard EMBOSS report file including the number of matches between the motif and each input sequence, length of match, start and end positions of match, and the motif-sequence alignment. Patterns for <b>patmatdb</b> are based on the format of pattern used in the PROSITE database, with the difference that the terminating dot '.' and the hyphens, '-', between the characters are optional.</p>


<H2>
Algorithm
</H2>

<p>Patterns for <b>patmatdb</b> are based on the format of pattern used in the PROSITE database, with the difference that the terminating dot '.' and the hyphens, '-', between the characters are optional.  For example: <tt>[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C</tt> means two Asps or Glus in any order followed by His, Ser, any residue other then Pro, then two of any residue followed by Pro followed by two to four of any residue followed by Cys. The search is case-independent, so <tt>AAA</tt> matches <tt>aaa</tt>. (Any string of at least 2 characters).</p>

<h3>Pattern specification</h3>

Patterns for patmatdb are based on the format of pattern used in the
PROSITE database, with the difference that the terminating dot '.' and
the hyphens, '-', between the characters are optional.

<p>

The PROSITE pattern definition from the PROSITE documentation follows. 

<ul>
<li> The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the amino acids are used.

<li> The symbol `x' is used for a position where any amino acid is
accepted.

<li> Ambiguities are indicated by listing the acceptable amino acids
      for a given position, between square parentheses `[ ]'. For
      example: [ALT] stands for Ala or Leu or Thr.

<li> Ambiguities are also indicated by listing between a pair of curly
      brackets `{ }' the amino acids that are not accepted at a given
      position. For example: {AM} stands for any amino acid except Ala
      and Met.

<li> Each element in a pattern is separated from its neighbor by a
      `-'.  (Optional in patmatdb).

<li> Repetition of an element of the pattern can be indicated by
      following that element with a numerical value or a numerical
      range between parenthesis. Examples: x(3) corresponds to x-x-x,
      x(2,4) corresponds to x-x or x-x-x or x-x-x-x.

<li> When a pattern is restricted to either the N- or C-terminal of a
      sequence, that pattern either starts with a `&lt;' symbol or
      respectively ends with a `&gt;' symbol.

<li> A period ends the pattern. (Optional in patmatdb).

</ul>

<p>

For example, in SWISSPROT entry 100K_RAT you can look for the pattern: 

<p>

<pre>
[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C
</pre>

<p>

This means: Two Asps or Glus in any order followed by His, Ser, any residue
other then Pro, then two of any residue followed by Pro followed by two to four
of any residue followed by Cys. 

<p>

The search is case-independent, so 'AAA' matches 'aaa'.
