<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<p><b>skipseq</b> is a variant of the standard program for reading and writing sequences, <b>seqret</b>. It performs exactly the same function except that it skips the first specified number of sequences from the input stream and writes out the rest of them.  In all other respects, <b>skipseq</b> is the same as <b>seqret</b>.  There are many options built-in into EMBOSS for detailed specification of the input and output sequences, for example the sequence type and file format.  Optionally, feature information will be read and written.</p>

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<p>See the documentation for <b>seqret</b> to see the full range of things that you can do when reading and writing sequences.</p>
<p><b>seqret</b> has an option to allow it to only read the first sequence from a multiple set of sequences (<tt>-firstonly</tt>). <b>seqret</b> cannot, however, skip the first few sequences from a multiple set of sequence, writing out the rest; this is what <b>skipseq</b> is for.</p>


<H2>
    References
</H2>

None.

<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

You may skip all of the input files.
<br>
If the -skip value is greater than or equal to the number of input
sequences, there is no warning: this is legal.

<H2>
    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

None.

<H2>
    Exit status
</H2>

It always exits with status 0.
