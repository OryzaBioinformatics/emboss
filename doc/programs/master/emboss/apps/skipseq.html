<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>skipseq</b> skips the first few sequences in a multiple set of
sequences, and writes out the rest of them. 

<p>

<b>skipseq</b> is a variant of the standard program for reading and
writing sequences, <b>seqret</b>. 

<p>

<b>seqret</b> has an option to allow it to only read the first sequence
from a multiple set of sequences (-firstonly).  <b>seqret</b> cannot,
however, skip the first few sequences from a multiple set of sequence,
writing out the rest; this is what <b>skipseq</b> is for.

<p>


In all other respects, <b>skipseq</b> is the same as <b>seqret</b>.
