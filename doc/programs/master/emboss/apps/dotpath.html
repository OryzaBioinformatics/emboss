<H2>
    Function
</H2>
<!--#include file="inc/dotpath.ione" -->

<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<p><b>dotpath</b> generates a dotplot from two input sequences.  The dotplot is an intuitive graphical representation of the regions of similarity between two sequences. Sequence "words" of a user-specified length are compared and all exact word matches between the two sequences are recorded.  The set of the longest possible but non-overlapping matches is identified. The two sequences are the axes of the rectangular dotplot.  Wherever there is an exact matching word in the two sequences a line is plotted.</p>


<H2>
Algorithm
</H2>
<p><b>dotpath</b> uses the same algorithm as <b>diffseq</b> and <b>dottup</b> for finding a minimal set of exact matches between two sequences. It finds all identical words of size <tt>-wordsize</tt> or greater in the two sequences. It then reduces the matches found to the minimal set of matches that do not overlap.  This set is rendered as lines in the dotplot.</p>

    Input file format

<!--#include file="inc/dotpath.input" -->


<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

In normal operation, a dotplot image is displayed.
<p>

With the <b>-data</b> qualifier a file of the positions of the
matches in the minimal non-overlapping set of matches is output.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<p>For similar sequences, <b>dotpath</b> provides a convenient way to find a path that aligns the two sequences well. It is not a true optimal path as produced by the dynamic programming algorithms used in <b>water</b> or <b>needle</b>, but for very closely related sequences it will produce the same result.  In contast to full alignment, it works very quickly with very long sequences.</p>

<p>The entire set of matches found can be displayed with the -overlaps qualifier.  This shows all matches in red, except for those in the minimal path (non-overlapping set) which are shown in black, as normal.</p>

<p>Using a longer word size will create a dottplot with relatively less noise; the matches are longer and therefore more likely to have biological meaning. Such runs will be much faster, but of course are less sensitive.</p>

<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

If you give a small word size with a very large sequence you will run
out of memory.  If this happens, try again with a larger word size.

<P>
This program is closely based on <b>dottup</b> with the addition of
by default displaying only the minimal set of non-overlapping matches. 
<P>

This program uses the same algorithm as <b>diffseq</b> for finding a
minimal set of very good matches between two sequences.  <b>diffseq</b>
may be more convenient if you are looking at the differences between two
nearly identical sequences.
