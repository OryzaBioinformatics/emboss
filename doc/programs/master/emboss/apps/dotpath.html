<H2>
    Description
</H2>

A dotplot is a graphical representation of the regions of similarity
between two sequences. 
<P>

The two sequences are placed on the axes of a rectangular image and
wherever there is a similarity between the sequences a dot is placed on
the image. 
<P>

Where the two sequences have substantial regions of similarity, many
dots align to form diagonal lines.  It is therefore possible to see at a
glance where there are local regions of similarity. 
<P>

<b>dotpath</b> is very similar to the program <b>dottup</b> which looks
for places where words (tuples) of a specified length have an exact
match in both sequences and draws a diagonal line over the position of
these words.
<P>


Using a longer word size thus displays less random noise, runs
extremely quickly, but is less sensitive. 
<P>

<b>dotpath</b> finds all matches of size <b>-wordsize</b> or greater
between two sequences.  It then reduces the matches found to the minimal
set of long matches that do not overlap.  This is a way of finding the
(nearly) optimal path aligning two sequences.  It is not the true
optimal path as produced by the algorithms used in <b>water</b> or
<b>needle</b>, but for very closely related sequences it will produce
the same result and will work well with very long sequences. 
<P>

If you wish to compare the path found by <b>dotpath</b> to the set of
all matches found then the qualifier <b>-overlaps</b> will show all
matches in red except for the matches in the minimal path which are
shown in black, as normal.

    Input file format
</H2>
<!--#include file="inc/dotpath.input" -->


<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

In normal operation, a dotplot image is displayed.
<p>

With the <b>-data</b> qualifier a file of the positions of the
matches in the minimal non-overlapping set of matches is output.

<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

If you give a small word size with a very large sequence you will run
out of memory.  If this happens, try again with a larger word size.

<!--#include file="inc/dotpath.isee" -->

<P>
This program is closely based on <b>dottup</b> with the addition of
by default displaying only the minimal set of non-overlapping matches. 
<P>

This program uses the same algorithm as <b>diffseq</b> for finding a
minimal set of very good matches between two sequences.  <b>diffseq</b>
may be more convenient if you are looking at the differences between two
nearly identical sequences.
