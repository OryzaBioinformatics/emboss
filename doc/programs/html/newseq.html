Type in a short new sequence


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This allows you to type a sequence into a file in a quick and
easy manner.

<p>
The length of the sequence you can type in is restricted to a
fairly short length (typically less than 255 characters).  This
length restriction is not a property of the EMBOSS package, but of the
computer system you are using.  This is because as you type in
response to a prompt from this program, what you type is stored in the
computer operating system before being handed over to the program. 
There is often a limit of less than 255 characters on the length of a
response that a computer system will allow you to give. 

<p>
Despite this restriction, it is expected that this program will
be a useful and easy way of constructing new sequence files. 

<p>
(You wouldn't want to type a long sequence in by hand, anyway,
would you?)

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>


Type in a short sequence to the file 'mycc.pep' in EMBL format:
<pre>
% newseq
Type in a short new sequence.
Output sequence [outfile.fasta]: embl::mycc.pep
Name of the sequence: cytoc
Description of the sequence: fragment of cytochrome C
Type of sequence

         N : Nucleic
         P : Protein
Type of sequence [N]: p
Enter the sequence: KKKEERADLIAY
</pre>

<p>
Display the resulting new file:
<p>
<pre>
% more mycc.pep
ID   cytoc          STANDARD;      PRT;    12 AA.
DE   fragment of cytochrome C
SQ   SEQUENCE    12 AA;   1464 MW;  2BF1DB53 CRC32;
     KKKEERADLI AY

   Mandatory qualifiers:

  [-name]              string     The name of of the sequence should be a
                                  single word that you will use to identify
                                  the sequence. It should have no (or few)
                                  punctuation characters in it.

                                  Because of the limitation of the operating
                                  system, you will only be able to type in a
                                  short sequence of (typically) 250

The length of the sequence you can type in is restricted to a
fairly short length (typically less than 255 characters). 
If your computer beeps at you, you will typically have to delete
the last character you typed and press the RETURN key.
