</H2>
Codon usage table comparison
<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<p><b>codcmp</b> reads two codon usage table files and writes to file the differences in codon usage fractions between the two tables.</p>
<p>The usage fraction of a codon is its proportion (0 to 1) of the total number of the codons in the sequences used to construct the usage table. For each codon that is used in both tables, it takes the difference between the usage fractions in the two tables.  The sum of the differences and the sum of the differences squared is reported in the output file.  It also counts the number of the 64 possible codons which are unused (i.e. has a usage fraction of 0) in either one or the other or both of the codon usage tables, and writes this to the output file.</p>



<H3>
   Statistical significance
</H3>

<b>Question:</b>

<p>

How do you interpret the statistical significance of any difference
between the tables?

<p>

<b>Answer:</b>

<p>

This is a very interesting question.  I don't think that there is any
way to say if it is statistically significant just from looking at it,
as it is essentially a descriptive statistic about the difference
between two 64-mer vectors.  If you have a whole lot of sequences and
codcmp results for all the possible pairwise comparisons, then the
resulting distance matrix can be used to build a phylogenetic tree based
on codon usage. 

<p>

However, if you generate a series of random sequences, measure their codon 
usage and then do codcmp between each of your test sequences and all the 
random sequences, you could then use a z-test to see if the result between 
the two test sequences was outside of the top or bottom 5%.

<p>

This would assume that the codcmp results were normally distributed, but
you could test that too.  The simplest way is just to plot them and look 
for a bell-curve.  For more rigour, find the mean and standard deviation of 
your results from the random sequences, use the normal distribution 
equation to generate a theoretical distribution for that mean and standard 
deviation, and then perform a chi square between the random data and the 
theoretically generated normal distribution.  If you generate two sets of 
random data, each based on your two test sequences, an F-test should be 
used to establish that they have equal variances.  Then you can safely go 
ahead and perform the z-test.

<p>

You could use shuffle to base your random sequences on the test
sequences - so that would ensure the randomised background had the same
nucleotide content. 

<p>

F-tests, z-tests and chi-tests can all be done in Excel, as well as
being standard in most statistical analysis packages.

    Data files
</H2>

<p><b>codcmp</b> requires two codon usage tables which are read by default from the EMBOSS data file from <tt>Ehum.cut</tt> in the data/CODONS directory of the EMBOSS distribution.  If the name of a codon usage file is specified on the command line, then this file will first be searched for in the current directory and then in the <tt>data/CODONS</tt> directory of the EMBOSS distribution. </p>


<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>

    Notes

<p>The following notes based on Derek Gatherer's comments are useful for interpreting the significance of any difference between the tables.</p>

<p>It's not normally possible to be certain a a difference is statistically significant just from looking at it, as it is essentially a descriptive statistic about the difference between two 64-mer vectors. If you have a whole lot of sequences and <b>codcmp</b> results for all the possible pairwise comparisons, then the resulting distance matrix can be used to build a phylogenetic tree based on codon usage.</p>

<p>However, if you generate a series of random sequences, measure their codon usage and then do <b>codcmp</b> between each of your test sequences and all the random sequences, you could then use a z-test to see if the result between the two test sequences was outside of the top or bottom 5%.</p>

<p>This would assume that the <b>codcmp</b> results were normally distributed, but you could test that too. The simplest way is just to plot them and look for a bell-curve. For more rigour, find the mean and standard deviation of your results from the random sequences, use the normal distribution equation to generate a theoretical distribution for that mean and standard deviation, and then perform a chi square between the random data and the theoretically generated normal distribution. If you generate two sets of random data, each based on your two test sequences, an F-test should be used to establish that they have equal variances. Then you can safely go ahead and perform the z-test.</p>

<p>You could use the shuffle program to base your random sequences on the test sequences - so that would ensure the randomised background had the same nucleotide content.  F-tests, z-tests and chi-tests can all be done in Excel, as well as being standard in most statistical analysis packages.</p>
