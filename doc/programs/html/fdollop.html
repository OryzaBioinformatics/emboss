Dollo and polymorphism parsimony algorithm

<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Estimates phylogenies by the Dollo or polymorphism parsimony criteria
for discrete character data with two states (0 and 1). Also
reconstructs ancestral states and allows weighting of
characters. Dollo parsimony is particularly appropriate for
restriction sites data; with ancestor states specified as unknown it
may be appropriate for restriction fragments data.


<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

This program carries out the Dollo and polymorphism parsimony
methods. The Dollo parsimony method was first suggested in print in
verbal form by Le Quesne (1974) and was first well-specified by Farris
(1977). The method is named after Louis Dollo since he was one of the
first to assert that in evolution it is harder to gain a complex
feature than to lose it. The algorithm explains the presence of the
state 1 by allowing up to one forward change 0--&gt;1 and as many
reversions 1--&gt;0 as are necessary to explain the pattern of states
seen. The program attempts to minimize the number of 1--&gt;0 reversions
necessary.

The assumptions of this method are in effect: 

<ol>

<li>
We know which state is the ancestral one (state 0). 

<li>
The characters are evolving independently. 

<li>
Different lineages evolve independently. 

<li>
The probability of a forward change (0--&gt;1) is small over the
evolutionary times involved.

<li>
The probability of a reversion (1--&gt;0) is also small, but still far
larger than the probability of a forward change, so that many
reversions are easier to envisage than even one extra forward change.

<li>
Retention of polymorphism for both states (0 and 1) is highly improbable. 

<li>
The lengths of the segments of the true tree are not so unequal that
two changes in a long segment are as probable as one in a short
segment.

</ol>

<p>
One problem can arise when using additive binary recoding to represent
a multistate character as a series of two-state characters. Unlike the
Camin-Sokal, Wagner, and Polymorphism methods, the Dollo method can
reconstruct ancestral states which do not exist. An example is given
in my 1979 paper. It will be necessary to check the output to make
sure that this has not occurred.

<p>
The polymorphism parsimony method was first used by me, and the
results published (without a clear specification of the method) by
Inger (1967). The method was independently published by Farris (1978a)
and by me (1979). The method assumes that we can explain the pattern
of states by no more than one origination (0--&gt;1) of state 1, followed
by retention of polymorphism along as many segments of the tree as are
necessary, followed by loss of state 0 or of state 1 where
necessary. The program tries to minimize the total number of
polymorphic characters, where each polymorphism is counted once for
each segment of the tree in which it is retained.

<p>
The assumptions of the polymorphism parsimony method are in effect: 

<ol>

<li>
The ancestral state (state 0) is known in each character. 

<li>
The characters are evolving independently of each other. 

<li>
Different lineages are evolving independently. 

<li>
Forward change (0--&gt;1) is highly improbable over the length of time
involved in the evolution of the group.

<li>
Retention of polymorphism is also improbable, but far more probable
that forward change, so that we can more easily envisage much
polymorhism than even one additional forward change.

<li>
Once state 1 is reached, reoccurrence of state 0 is very improbable,
much less probable than multiple retentions of polymorphism.

<li>
The lengths of segments in the true tree are not so unequal that we
can more easily envisage retention events occurring in both of two
long segments than one retention in a short segment.

</ol>

<p>
That these are the assumptions of parsimony methods has been
documented in a series of papers of mine: (1973a, 1978b, 1979, 1981b,
1983b, 1988b). For an opposing view arguing that the parsimony methods
make no substantive assumptions such as these, see the papers by
Farris (1983) and Sober (1983a, 1983b), but also read the exchange
between Felsenstein and Sober (1986).

<b>fdollop</b> reads discrete character data with "?", "P", "B" states
allowed. .


<h3>(0,1) Discrete character data</h3>

<p>
These programs are intended for the use of morphological
systematists who are dealing with discrete characters, or by molecular
evolutionists dealing with presence-absence data on restriction
sites. One of the programs (PARS) allows multistate characters, with
up to 8 states, plus the unknown state symbol "?". For the others, the
characters are assumed to be coded into a series of (0,1) two-state
characters. For most of the programs there are two other states
possible, "P", which stands for the state of Polymorphism for both
states (0 and 1), and "?", which stands for the state of ignorance: it
is the state "unknown", or "does not apply". The state "P" can also be
denoted by "B", for "both".

<p> There is a method invented by Sokal and Sneath (1963) for linear
sequences of character states, and fully developed for branching
sequences of character states by Kluge and Farris (1969) for recoding
a multistate character into a series of two-state (0,1)
characters. Suppose we had a character with four states whose
character-state tree had the rooted form:

<p>
<pre>
               1 ---> 0 ---> 2
                      |
                      |
                      V
                      3

</pre>

<p>
so that 1 is the ancestral state and 0, 2 and 3 derived states. We
can represent this as three two-state characters:


<p>
<pre>
                Old State           New States
                --- -----           --- ------
                    0                  001
                    1                  000
                    2                  011
                    3                  101

</pre>

<p>
The three new states correspond to the three arrows in the above
character state tree. Possession of one of the new states corresponds
to whether or not the old state had that arrow in its ancestry. Thus
the first new state corresponds to the bottommost arrow, which only
state 3 has in its ancestry, the second state to the rightmost of the
top arrows, and the third state to the leftmost top arrow. This coding
will guarantee that the number of times that states arise on the tree
(in programs MIX, MOVE, PENNY and BOOT) or the number of polymorphic
states in a tree segment (in the Polymorphism option of DOLLOP,
DOLMOVE, DOLPENNY and DOLBOOT) will correctly correspond to what would
have been the case had our programs been able to take multistate
characters into account. Although I have shown the above character
state tree as rooted, the recoding method works equally well on
unrooted multistate characters as long as the connections between the
states are known and contain no loops.

<p>
However, in the default option of programs DOLLOP, DOLMOVE,
DOLPENNY and DOLBOOT the multistate recoding does not necessarily work
properly, as it may lead the program to reconstruct nonexistent state
combinations such as 010. An example of this problem is given in my
paper on alternative phylogenetic methods (1979).

<p>
If you have multistate character data where the states are connected
in a branching "character state tree" you may want to do the binary
recoding yourself. Thanks to Christopher Meacham, the package contains
a program, FACTOR, which will do the recoding itself. For details see
the documentation file for FACTOR.

<p>
We now also have the program PARS, which can do parsimony for
unordered character states.

<b>fdollop</b> output is standard: a list of equally parsimonious
trees, and, if the user selects menu option 4, a table of the numbers
of reversions or retentions of polymorphism necessary in each
character. If any of the ancestral states has been specified to be
unknown, a table of reconstructed ancestral states is also
provided. When reconstructing the placement of forward changes and
reversions under the Dollo method, keep in mind that each polymorphic
state in the input data will require one "last minute" reversion. This
is included in the tabulated counts. Thus if we have both states 0 and
1 at a tip of the tree the program will assume that the lineage had
state 1 up to the last minute, and then state 0 arose in that
population by reversion, without loss of state 1.

<p>
If the user selects menu option 5, a table is printed out after each
tree, showing for each branch whether there are known to be changes in
the branch, and what the states are inferred to have been at the top
end of the branch. If the inferred state is a "?" there may be
multiple equally-parsimonious assignments of states; the user must
work these out for themselves by hand.

<p>
If the A option is used, then the program will infer, for any
character whose ancestral state is unknown ("?") whether the ancestral
state 0 or 1 will give the best tree. If these are tied, then it may
not be possible for the program to infer the state in the internal
nodes, and these will all be printed as ".". If this has happened and
you want to know more about the states at the internal nodes, you will
find helpful to use DOLMOVE to display the tree and examine its
interior states, as the algorithm in DOLMOVE shows all that can be
known in this case about the interior states, including where there is
and is not amibiguity. The algorithm in DOLLOP gives up more easily on
displaying these states.

<p>
If the U (User Tree) option is used and more than one tree is
supplied, the program also performs a statistical test of each of
these trees against the best tree. This test, which is a version of
the test proposed by Alan Templeton (1983) and evaluated in a test
case by me (1985a). It is closely parallel to a test using log
likelihood differences invented by Kishino and Hasegawa (1989), and
uses the mean and variance of step differences between trees, taken
across characters. If the mean is more than 1.96 standard deviations
different then the trees are declared significantly different. The
program prints out a table of the steps for each tree, the differences
of each from the highest one, the variance of that quantity as
determined by the step differences at individual characters, and a
conclusion as to whether that tree is or is not significantly worse
than the best one. It is important to understand that the test assumes
that all the binary characters are evolving independently, which is
unlikely to be true for many suites of morphological characters.

<p>
If there are more than two trees, the test done is an extension of the
KHT test, due to Shimodaira and Hasegawa (1999). They pointed out that
a correction for the number of trees was necessary, and they
introduced a resampling method to make this correction. In the version
used here the variances and covariances of the sums of steps across
characters are computed for all pairs of trees. To test whether the
difference between each tree and the best one is larger than could
have been expected if they all had the same expected number of steps,
numbers of steps for all trees are sampled with these covariances and
equal means (Shimodaira and Hasegawa's "least favorable hypothesis"),
and a P value is computed from the fraction of times the difference
between the tree's value and the lowest number of steps exceeds that
actually observed. Note that this sampling needs random numbers, and
so the program will prompt the user for a random number seed if one
has not already been supplied. With the two-tree KHT test no random
numbers are used.

<p>
In either the KHT or the SH test the program prints out a table of the
number of steps for each tree, the differences of each from the lowest
one, the variance of that quantity as determined by the differences of
the numbers of steps at individual characters, and a conclusion as to
whether that tree is or is not significantly worse than the best one.

<p>
If option 6 is left in its default state the trees found will be
written to a tree file, so that they are available to be used in other
programs. If the program finds multiple trees tied for best, all of
these are written out onto the output tree file. Each is followed by a
numerical weight in square brackets (such as [0.25000]). This is
needed when we use the trees to make a consensus tree of the results
of bootstrapping or jackknifing, to avoid overrepresenting replicates
that find many tied trees.
