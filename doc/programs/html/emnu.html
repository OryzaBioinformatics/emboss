Simple menu of EMBOSS applications


<H2>
    Description
</H2>



<b>emnu</b> displays a simple character-based menu that allows you to display
the names of emboss programs and select them.
<P>

It also displays the names of files in your current directory and allows
you to display their contents, copy them, delete them and do other
things with them. 
<P>

<b>emnu</b> allows to to move around the menus of programs or files
using the arrow keys.  Pressing RETURN when you have selected an item
will run a program or display a file. 
<p>

You can also navigate around the menu by typing the first few letters of
the option that you desire.  You will move to the item in the menu that first
matches those letters. 
<P>

You can also type in UNIX commands as if you were typing them in a UNIX
session.  (Of course, as you type, <b>emnu</b> will not know if you wish
to run a UNIX command or go to a menu item starting with the letters you
are typing, so you will see the menu selection changing as you type.  If
this irritates you and you are confident enough with UNIX commands to be
typing them directly, maybe you do not need to use <b>emnu</b>?)
<p>

If you run a command or program that creates one or more files, then when
you return to the menu, the command line will be set up to contain the
command <b>more</b> followed by the names of the files.  Pressing RETURN
to run this command will display the contents of these files.  If you do
not wish to see these files, just press <b>^C</b> to clear the command
line. 
<p>

You can also navigate around the menu and do many other things by typing
control keys and Function keys.  Control keys can be typed by pressing
the <b>Control</b> key and another key.  Control keys are written here
and in the online help text as a <b>^</b> and then the key's letter, for
example <i>^C</i> means Control-C. 
<p>

The control key commands that are most useful will be displayed in the
bottom two lines of the screen.  If in doubt, press the '?' key for
further help. 
<p>

If you are using <b>emnu</b> through a telnet session or in a 'xterm'
window, you may be able to click on menu options and on the bottom two
lines of help in the screen to select items.  (Double click on the menu
to run that item.)
<p>

The menus that are displayed are very simple.  They consist of the title
of the menu at the top of the screen, followed by several lines of
things to select.  The first two items are always 'EXIT' which takes you back
to the previous menu, and 'HELP' which shows help for this menu. 
<p>

The first menu you see (the GROUPS MENU) will consist of two columns of
the groups of EMBOSS programs.  You can move up and down, left and right
using the arrow keys.  The bottom two lines show useful control keys you
can type to do things.  You may be able to click on the help text
or on the menu items to select them.
<p>

The line above the two help lines is the command line.  This is where
the currently selected menu item or any command you type is displayed. 
See the <b>Usage</b> section of this document below to see useful
control codes for navigating and editing this command line.  You may
type in any UNIX command or any EMBOSS program name in this command
line.  It is common to add extra parameters or options to change the
default behaviour of an EMBOSS program.  You may edit the command line
to do this.  For example the program <b>seqret</b> can take many
options.  You may wish to type the command 'seqret -osf gcg' to
make <b>seqret</b> write out sequences in GCG format. 
<p>

Selecting any item in the GROUPS menu apart from 'EXIT' and 'HELP' will
select a sub-menu.  The 'ALL FILES' and 'NEW FILES' items will start a
menu displaying files, all others will display a menu of EMBOSS
programs. 
<P>

                                  MAIN MENU HELP
This menu system aims to make it easy to run EMBOSS programs and manage files.

You now have a menu of EMBOSS program groups. You can select any program group
and select the programs. Move to an option and press RETURN to select it.
You can move to menu options by typing the first few letters of the option name
or by using the cursor (arrow) keys.
You can also type any normal UNIX command and run it.

Before the program group options, are the following special options:
EXIT - exit the program
HELP - this page of help
ALL FILES - display files in this directory, view them, change directory, etc.
NEW FILES - display the files that have been created since 'em' started running
ALPHABETIC - listing of all EMBOSS programs
SEARCH - search for EMBOSS programs by name or description

The following control keys edit the command line:
^F forward, ^B back, ^A start, ^E end, ^C delete line, ^K delete to end of line

The following keys get other things:
F1,F2,F3,F5 -view, view sequence, copy and delete the last file looked at
^X exit, ^N/^T file menus, ^R recall stored file, TAB complete name of option

Press any key to continue...

<H3>
	Programs menus
</H3>

A typical EMBOSS PROGRAMS MENU is displayed below.
<P>

It starts with the normal 'EXIT' and 'HELP' items.  All the other items
are EMBOSS programs.  There is only one column of items.  Each item is
followed by a short description of the program.  Use of the UP and DOWN
arrow keys will move you up and down in the menu.  Use of the LEFT and
RIGHT arrow keys will also move you up and down in the menu. 
<p>

To get back to the GROUPS MENU, select the 'EXIT' option or type ^X. 
<p>

You may add any text you wish after the name of a selected EMBOSS
program.  For example, type ^E to go to the end of the command line and
type <b> -opt</b> after the program name to make the program ask you for
more than the minimal set of qualifiers when you run that program. 
<p>

To see detailed help on a program, move to the appropriate item and
press the <b>?</b> key. 
<p>

If you run a program that creates one or more files, then when
you return to the menu, the command line will be set up to contain the
command <b>more</b> followed by the names of the files.  Pressing RETURN
to run this command will display the contents of these files.  If you do
not wish to see these files, just press <b>^C</b> to clear the command
line. 
<p>

To run the program, just press RETURN.
<p>

NOTE: Once you start running any program, you are no longer talking to
the menu system, you are only talking to that program.  Therefore all of
the control codes for doing things like putting file names in the
command line will have no effect. 
<P>

<H3>
	All files menu
</H3>

Get to this menu by selecting the 'ALL FILES' option from the main
GROUPS menu, or type <b>^T</b> in any menu. 
<P>
This will show a list of the files in your current directory (folder).
<p>

The name of the current directory will be displayed as the title of the menu.
<p>

You can see the contents of a file by pressing RETURN when the file is
the currently selected item in the menu.  If the current item is a
directory (marked by the word <b>Dir</b> by the name) then you will go
into that directory and the FILES menu will change to display the files
in that directory.  All further programs will be run in that new
directory until you exit the menu program or you change directory again. 
Exiting from the FILES menu will not change back to the previous menu. 
<p>

There are many useful control keys for manipulating files:
<P>

The following change the way the files are sorted before displaying in the menu.
Having pressed one of these function keys, all subsequent file menus
will sort the files using the appropriate method.
<p>

<pre>
 F8  AlphaSort
     Sort the files by name (Start a files menu if not already in one) 

 F9  TimeSort   
     Sort the files by time (Start a files menu if not already in one) 
</pre>
<P>

The following will use the current files menu item to display, copy of
delete.  If you are not currently in a FILES menu or if the current item
is not a file, then the last valid file that you pressed RETURN on will
be remembered and used. 
<p>

The <b>^G</b> key is useful for adding this default file name to a
command you are typing into the command line. 
<p>

Note: you can use the commands in any menu and they will work on the
default file. 

<p>
<pre>
 F1  ViewFile   
     Show the contents of the current menu item file, or last file viewed 

 F2  View Seq   
     Display the current file as a sequence 

 F4  CopyFile   
     Copy the current file to a new file 

 F5  DelFile   
     Delete the current file 

 ^G  GetFile   
     Add the name of the current file to the command line 
</pre>
<p>

Separate from the memory of the default file used by the above commands
is a specific method of remembering the name of an item in the FILES
menus and recalling it into the command line at a later date by using
the following pair of key codes. 
<p>

<pre>
 ^S  StoreFile   
     Remember the name of the current menu item file 

 ^R  RecalFile   
     Add the stored file name to the command line 
</pre>
<p>

And finally, it is often useful to be able to make a new directory
(folder) and go directly into that new directory. 
<p>
<pre>
 F3  New Dir    
     Create a new directory and go into it 
</pre>

                                  numerous and often vaguely phrased than the

                                  names as: 'NAME1', 'NAME2', 'NAME1 NAME2',
                                  NAME2 NAME1'. The non-expanded names are
                                  simply like: 'NAME1 NAME2'.

The name of this program, <b>emnu</b>, comes from the observation that 
<i>'emnu'</i> is a mangled <i>'menu'</i>.

    Exit status
</H2>


It always exits with status 0. 

<H2>
    Known bugs
</H2>

It crashes if you resize the xterm window to make it smaller than when
the menu system started. 
<p>

It sometimes crashes when the xterm window is resized to be less than 80
characters wide and the menu lines are longer than this.
<p>

When using the '-explode' option, one of the program
groups is expanded to be 'HELP'.  Selecting this option simply gives the
help for the Groups Menu.  I don't intend to alter this situation, it is
a feature.
<p>

delete_file() doesn't delete directories - this is because
we don't allow directories to be default files.  Should we? It would
complicate things like copy_file.

<H2>
    History
</H2>

Many concepts (but no code) for this application cames from the editor
<b>pico</b> and the file browser 'Midnight Commander' (<b>mc</b>). 
<p>

Code was taken liberally from the example programs in the <b>ncurses</b>
package.
<p>

The name of this program, <b>emnu</b>, was a suggestion from Peter Rice
after the author had run through many temporary names ('esme' -
Extremely Simple Menu for EMBOSS, 'em' - EMBOSS Menu, 'm' - Menu).
