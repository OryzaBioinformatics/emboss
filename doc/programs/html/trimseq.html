Trim ambiguous bits off the ends of sequences


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This program is used to tidy up the ends of sequences, removing all
the bits that you would really rather were not published.

<p>
Specifically, it:
<ul>

<li>removes all gap characters from the ends.
<li>removes X's and N's (in nucleic sequences) from the ends.
<li>optionally removes *'s from the ends
<li>optionally removes IUPAC ambiguity codes from the ends
  (B and Z in proteins, M,R,W,S,Y,K,V,H,D and B in nucleic sequences)
</ul>
<p>
It then optionally trims off poor quality regions from the end, using
a threshold percentage of unwanted characters in a window which is moved
along the sequence from the ends. The unwanted characters which are used
are X's and N's (in nucleic sequences), optionally *'s, and optionally
IUPAC ambiguity codes.

<p>
The program stops trimming the ends when the percentage of
unwanted characters in the moving window drops below the
threshold percentage. 
	
<p>
Thus if the window size is set to 1 and the percentage threshold
is 100, no further poor quality regions will be removed.
If the window size is set to 5 and the percentage threshold is 40
then the sequence  AAGCTNNNNATT   will be trimmed to AAGCT,
while AAGCTNATT or AAGCTNNNNATTT will not be trimmed as less than
40% of the last 5 characters are N's.

<p>
After trimming these poor quality regions, it will again then
trim off any dangling gap characters from the ends .

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>


Tidy up the sequence ends, stopping at the first wanted code
<pre>
% trimseq xyz.seq xyz_clean.seq -window 1 -percent 100
</pre>

<p>
Tidy up the sequence ends, removing poor bits at the ends
<pre>
% trimseq xyz.seq xyz_clean.seq -window 5 -percent 40
</pre>

<p>
Tidy up the sequence ends, removing very poor bits at the ends
<pre>
% trimseq xyz.seq xyz_clean.seq -window 20 -percent 80
</pre>

<p>
Tidy up the sequence ends, removing even maginally poor bits at the ends
<pre>
% trimseq xyz.seq xyz_clean.seq -window 20 -percent 10
</pre>

<p>
Tidy up the sequence ends, removing poor bits including ambiguity codes
<pre>
% trimseq xyz.seq xyz_clean.seq -window 20 -percent 50 -strict
</pre>

<p>
Tidy up the sequence ends, removing asterisks from a protein end
<pre>
% trimseq xyz.seq xyz_clean.seq -window 1 -percent 100 -star
</pre>

<p>
Tidy up the sequence ends, removing poor bits at only the left end
<pre>
% trimseq xyz.seq xyz_clean.seq -window 20 -percent 50 -noright
</pre>

   Mandatory qualifiers:

  [-outseq]            seqoutall  Output sequence(s) USA

   Optional qualifiers:
   -window             integer    This determines the size of the region that
                                  is considered when deciding whether the
                                  percentage of ambiguity is greater than the
                                  threshold. A value of 5 means that a region
                                  of 5 letters in the sequence is shifted
                                  along the sequence from the ends and
                                  trimming is done only if there is a greater
                                  or equal percentage of ambiguity than the
                                  threshold percentage.
   -percent            float      This is the threshold of the percentage

                                  trim a sequence.
   -strict             bool       In nucleic sequences, trim off not only N's
                                  and X's, but also the nucleotide IUPAC
                                  ambiguity codes M, R, W, S, Y, K, V, H, D
                                  and B. In protein sequences, trim off not
                                  only X's but also B and Z.
   -star               bool       In protein sequences, trim off not only X's,
                                  but also the *'s

   Advanced qualifiers:
   -[no]left           bool       Trim at the start

</H2>


If you use the '-star' qualifier and set the window size to greater
than 1, you may trim bits of sequence with internal *'s. This may
not be what you expected.
