Merge two large overlapping nucleic acid sequences


<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.

        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will
        do what he wants. 

        Long description.

        Why it is useful.

        When it should/shouldn't be used.

        Algorithms

        Expanded description.

        eg: Reverse engineers Wheedle's 'talpsgob' program. This does a 
        splurge of the 5' end of the sequence followed by a durm.
        The net effect is a 5' end splurt.
        etc. for as long as is required (several pages is not unreasonable)
  -->

<b>megamerger</b> takes two overlapping sequences and merges them into one sequence. 
It could thus be regarded as the opposite of what splitter does.
<P>

The sequences can be very long.
The program does a match of all sequence words of size 20 (by default). It then reduces
this to the minimum set of overlapping matches by sorting the matches in order of size (largest size first)
and then for each such match it removes any smaller matches that overlap. The result is a set of the longest
ungapped alignments between the two sequences that do not overlap with each other. If the two sequences are
identical in their region of overlap then there will be one region of match and no mismatches.
<P>

It should be possible to merge sequences that are Mega bytes long.
Compare this with the program <b>merger</b> which does a more accurate
alignment of more divergent sequences using the Needle and Wunsch algorithm but which uses much more memory.
<P>

The sequences should ideally be identical in their region of overlap.
If there are any mismatches between the two sequences then <b>megamerger</b> will still attempt to
create a merged sequence, but you should check that this is what you required.
<P>

A report of the actions of <b>megamerger</b> is written out.
Any actions that require a choice between using regions of the two sequences
where they have a mismatch is marked with the word <b>WARNING!</b>.
The sequence in these regions is written out in uppercase.
All other regions of the output sequence are written in lowercase.
<p>

Where there is a mismatch then the sequence that is chosen to supply the region of the mismatch in the
final merged sequence is that sequence whose mismatch region is furthest from the start of end of the sequence.

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.
 -->


Here is a sample session with megamerger, there are many mismatches between these two sequences and the
merged sequence should therefore be treated with great caution:

<pre>

% megamerger embl:ap000504 embl:af129756
Merge two large overlapping nucleic acid sequences
Output sequence [ap000504.merged]: 
Output file [stdout]: report
Word size [20]:

A merged sequence is written out.
<P>

Where there has been a mismatch between the two sequences, the merged sequence is written out in uppercase
and the sequence whose mismatch region is furthest from the edges of the sequence is used in the merged sequence.
<P>

The name and description of the first input sequence is used for the name and description of the output sequence.

A report of the merger is written out.
<P>

A typical report where there are many mismatches, taken from the example above follows:
