    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
        Algorithms
  -->

<b>cons</b> calculates a consensus sequence from a multiple sequence
alignment.  To obtain the consensus, the sequence weights and a scoring
matrix are used to calculate a score at each position in the alignment. 
<P>

The residue (or nucleotide) <b>i</b> in an alignment column, is compared
to all other residues (<b>j</b>) in the column.  The score for <b>i</b>
is the sum over all residues <b>j</b> (not <b>i=j</b>) of the
score(<b>ij</b>)*weight(<b>j</b>) .  Where score(<b>ij</b>) is taken
from a nucleotide or protein scoring matrix (see <b>-datafile</b>
qualifier) and the "weight(<b>j</b>)" is the weighting given to the
sequence <b>j</b>, which is given in the alignment file.
<P>

The highest scoring type of residue is then found in the column.  If the
number of positive matches for this residue is greater than the
"plurality value" then this residue is the consensus.  The positive
matches for a residue <b>i</b> are calculated as being the sum of
weights of all the residues that increase the score of residue <b>i</b>
(i.e.  positive). 
<P>

Where no consensus is found at a position <b>i</b>, an 'n' or an 'x'
character is output; (depending on it being a DNA or protein sequence).
<P>

   The "plurality" qualifier allows the user to set a cut-off for the
number of positive matches below which there is no consensus.
<P>

    The "identity" qualifier provides the facility of setting the required
number of identities at a site for it to give a consensus at that
position.  Therefore, if this is set to the number of sequences in the
alignment only columns of identities contribute to the consensus. 
<P>

    The "setcase" qualifier sets the threshold for the positive matches
above which the consensus is is upper-case and below which the consensus
is in lower-case. 
<P>

<pre>
   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-msf]               seqset     File containing a sequence alignment.
  [-outseq]            seqout     Output sequence USA

   Optional qualifiers:
   -datafile           matrix     This is the scoring matrix file used when
                                  comparing sequences. By default it is the
                                  file 'EBLOSUM62' (for proteins) or the file
                                  'EDNAFULL' (for nucleic sequences). These
                                  files are found in the 'data' directory of
                                  the EMBOSS installation.
   -plurality          float      Set a cut-off for the number of positive
                                  matches below which there is no consensus.
                                  The default plurality is taken as half the
                                  total weight of all the sequences in the
                                  alignment.
   -identity           integer    Provides the facility of setting the
                                  required number of identities at a site for
                                  it to give a consensus at that position.
                                  Therefore, if this is set to the number of
                                  sequences in the alignment only columns of
                                  identities contribute to the consensus.
   -name               string     Name of the consensus sequence
   -setcase            float      Sets the threshold for the positive matches
                                  above which the consensus is is upper-case
                                  and below which the consensus is in
                                  lower-case.

   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   General qualifiers:
  -help                boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general

It uses the standard set of scoring matrix data files.
<P>

<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
