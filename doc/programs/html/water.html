Smith-Waterman local alignment


<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>water</b> uses the Smith-Waterman algorithm (modified for speed
enhancments) to calculate the local alignment.
<P>

The Smith-Waterman algorithm is a member of the class of algorithms
that can calculate the best score and local alignment in the order of mn
steps, (where 'n' and 'm' are the lengths of the two sequences).  These
dynamic programming algorithms were first developed for protein sequence
comparison by Smith and Waterman, though similar methods were
independently devised during the late 1960's and early 1970's for use in
the fields of speech processing and computer science. 
<P>

A local alignment searches for regions of local similarity between two
sequences and need not include the entire length of the sequences. 
Local alignment methods are very useful for scanning databases or other
circumsatnces when you wish to find matches between small regions of
sequences, for example between protein domains. 
<P>

Dynamic programming methods ensure
the optimal local alignment by exploring all possible alignments and
choosing the best.  It does this by reading in a scoring matrix that
contains values for every possible residue or nucleotide match.  <b>water</b>
finds an alignment with the maximum possible score where the score of an
alignment is equal to the sum of the matches taken from the scoring
matrix. 
<P>

An important problem is the treatment of gaps, i.e., spaces inserted to
optimise the alignment score.  A penalty is subtracted from the score
for each gap opened (the 'gap open' penalty) and a penalty is subtracted
from the score for the total number of gap spaces multiplied by a cost
(the 'gap extension' penalty). 
<P>

Typically, the cost of extending a gap is set to be 5-10 times lower
than the cost for opening a gap. 
<P>

<H2>
    Usage

Here is a sample session with water.

   -gapopen            float      The gap open penalty is the score taken away
                                  when a gap is created. The best value
                                  depends on the choice of comparison matrix.
                                  The default value assumes you are using the
                                  EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein sequences, and
                                  the EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide
                                  sequences.
   -gapextend          float      The gap extension, penalty is added to the
                                  standard gap penalty for each base or
                                  residue in the gap. This is how long gaps
                                  are penalized. Usually you will expect a few
                                  long gaps rather than many short gaps, so
                                  the gap extension penalty should be lower
                                  than the gap penalty. An exception is where
                                  one or both sequences are single reads with
                                  possible sequencing errors in which case you
                                  would expect many single base gaps. You can
                                  get this result by setting the gap open
                                  penalty to zero (or very low) and using the
                                  gap extension penalty to control gap

    Data files
</H2>


For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution
matrix. For nucleotide sequence, EDNAFULL is used. Others can be specified.

<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<b>water</b> is a true implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm
and so produces a full path matrix.  It therefore cannot be used with
genome sized sequences unless you have a <b>lot</b> of memory and a lot
of time.

<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

Local alignment methods only report the best matching areas between two
sequences - there may be a large number of alternative local alignments
that do not score as highly.  If two proteins share more than one common
region, for example one has a single copy of a particular domain while
the other has two copies, it may be possible to "miss" the second and
subsequent alignments.  You will be able to see this situation if you
have done a dotplot and your local alignment does not show all the
features you expected to see. 
<P>

<b>water</b> is for aligning the best matching subsequences of two
sequences.  It does not necessarily align whole sequences against each
other; you should use <b>needle</b> if you wish to align closely related
sequences along their whole lengths. 
<P>

A true Smith Waterman implementation like <b>water</b> needs memory
proportional to the product of the sequence lengths.  For two sequences
of length 10,000,000 and 1,000 it therefore needs memory proportional to
10,000,000,000 characters.  Two arrays of this size are produced, one of
ints and one of floats so multiply that figure by 8 to get the memory
usage in bytes.  That doesn't include other overheads.  Therefore only
use water and needle for accurate alignment of reasonably short
sequences. 

<p>



If you run out of memory, try using <b>supermatcher</b> or
<b>matcher</b>.

<p>
<b>matcher</b> is a local alignment program that is less rigorous than <p>water</p> and therefore runs more quickly. It may be useful for database searching.

<p>
<b>supermatcher</b> is designed for local alignments of very large sequences and is even less rigorous in its implementation.
