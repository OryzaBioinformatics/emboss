Finds protein sequence regions with a biased composition


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


<b>oddcomp</b> searches a series of protein files, reporting the identifier for
those that exceed a certain amino acid composition threshold in a
portion of the sequence. 

<p>
<b>oddcomp</b> was written to answer the question 'which proteins contain at
least n X and m Y in p residues'. 

<p>
One could search for serine rich or polyglutamine rich, collagen helix,
or similar proteins using this program. 

<p>
<b>oddcomp</b> takes as input an amino acid composition data file in the same
format as the output from compseq.  It can tolerate any word length
within reason for the memory capacity of the machine in question.  Only
the first two fields in the composition data file are used: the word and
the number of occurrences.  Any word not mentioned is initialised to a
threshold of zero. 

<p>
<b>oddcomp</b> measures the amino acid composition (this can be dimers etc as
well as monomers) in a sliding window.  If and when composition meets or
exceeds all the specified thresholds, the sequence is reported and
<b>oddcomp</b> moves to the next sequence.  It does not report where in the
sequence it found the matching region, merely the sequence ID. 

<p>
<b>oddcomp</b> was originally written to identify SR/RS containing proteins. 
eg.  specifying a window of forty amino acids containing at least 3 SR
and 4 RS words. 

<p>
To search for a specific set of words in a sequence, edit the input
composition data file to delete any words from the input file in which
you are not interested.  The search is a boolean AND so there must be
(from the short example above) at least 3 SR AND at least 4 RS for the
sequence to be reported.  If your total words specified exceeds
window-wordlength+1 you will never get any hits. 

<p>

Only one word size can be used and is specified at the top of the file
in compseq-style output. 

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>


An example of the use of <b>oddcomp</b> to search for entries in swissprot with
at least 1 SR AND at least 2 RS follows:

<p>

<pre>
% oddcomp
Finds protein sequence regions with a biased composition
Input sequence(s): sw:*
Output file [5h1d_fugru.oddcomp]: out.odd
Input file: test.comp
Window size to consider (e.g. 30 aa) [30]:

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>


The data file ('test.comp') used in the example follows:


<hr>
<pre>
# Example input file for oddcomp
Word size       2
Total count     0

#
# Word  Obs Count       Obs Frequency   Exp Frequency   Obs/Exp Frequency
#
RS      2               0               0               0
SR      1               0               0               0

Other   0               0               0               0
</pre>
<hr>

<p>

The columns "Obs Frequency", "Exp Frequency" and "Obs/Exp Frequency" are
not required - they were simply included in this example to show the
similarity between this input file format and the output of the program
<A HREF="compseq.html">compseq</A>.  A compseq output file can be used as the
input to <b>oddcomp</b> - the extra columns are ignored by
<b>oddcomp</b>. 

<p>

A minimal composition input data file would look like this:

<hr>
<pre>
Word size       2
Total count     0
RS      2
SR      1
</pre>
<hr>

<p>

Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.

<p>

The first non-comment line should start with 'Word size' and will
specify the word size to use.

<p>

A line starting with the word 'Total' is required.

<p>

Anything after the line starting with the word 'Total' will be read as
word count data. 

<p>

Word count data consists of a word to search for and the count of that
word to search for within the sliding window.  The columns are separated
by one or more spaces or TAB characters. Anything after these two columns
will be ignored. 

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


A list of sequence name identifiers.

The output from the above example follows:

<p>

<hr>
<pre>
#
# Output from 'oddcomp'
#
# The Expected frequencies are taken from the file: test.comp
#
#       Word size: 2
