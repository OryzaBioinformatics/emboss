<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Interactive construction of phylogenies from discrete character data
with two states (0 and 1) using the Dollo or polymorphism parsimony
criteria. Evaluates parsimony and compatibility criteria for those
phylogenies and displays reconstructed states throughout the
tree. This can be used to find parsimony or compatibility estimates by
hand. 



<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


DOLMOVE is an interactive parsimony program which uses the Dollo and
Polymorphism parsimony criteria. It is inspired on Wayne Maddison and
David Maddison's marvellous program MacClade, which is written for
Apple MacIntosh computers. DOLMOVE reads in a data set which is
prepared in almost the same format as one for the Dollo and
polymorhism parsimony program DOLLOP. It allows the user to choose an
initial tree, and displays this tree on the screen. The user can look
at different characters and the way their states are distributed on
that tree, given the most parsimonious reconstruction of state changes
for that particular tree. The user then can specify how the tree is to
be rearraranged, rerooted or written out to a file. By looking at
different rearrangements of the tree the user can manually search for
the most parsimonious tree, and can get a feel for how different
characters are affected by changes in the tree topology.

<p>
This program is compatible with fewer computer systems than the other
programs in PHYLIP. It can be adapted to PCDOS systems or to any
system whose screen or terminals emulate DEC VT100 terminals (such as
Telnet programs for logging in to remote computers over a TCP/IP
network, VT100-compatible windows in the X windowing system, and any
terminal compatible with ANSI standard terminals). For any other
screen types, there is a generic option which does not make use of
screen graphics characters to display the character states. This will
be less effective, as the states will be less easy to see when
displayed.

<b>fdolmove</b>  reads discrete character data with "?", "P", "B" states
allowed. .


<h3>(0,1) Discrete character data</h3>

<p>
These programs are intended for the use of morphological
systematists who are dealing with discrete characters, or by molecular
evolutionists dealing with presence-absence data on restriction
sites. One of the programs (PARS) allows multistate characters, with
up to 8 states, plus the unknown state symbol "?". For the others, the
characters are assumed to be coded into a series of (0,1) two-state
characters. For most of the programs there are two other states
possible, "P", which stands for the state of Polymorphism for both
states (0 and 1), and "?", which stands for the state of ignorance: it
is the state "unknown", or "does not apply". The state "P" can also be
denoted by "B", for "both".

<p> There is a method invented by Sokal and Sneath (1963) for linear
sequences of character states, and fully developed for branching
sequences of character states by Kluge and Farris (1969) for recoding
a multistate character into a series of two-state (0,1)
characters. Suppose we had a character with four states whose
character-state tree had the rooted form:

<p>
<pre>
               1 ---> 0 ---> 2
                      |
                      |
                      V
                      3

</pre>

<p>
so that 1 is the ancestral state and 0, 2 and 3 derived states. We
can represent this as three two-state characters:


<p>
<pre>
                Old State           New States
                --- -----           --- ------
                    0                  001
                    1                  000
                    2                  011
                    3                  101

</pre>

<p>
The three new states correspond to the three arrows in the above
character state tree. Possession of one of the new states corresponds
to whether or not the old state had that arrow in its ancestry. Thus
the first new state corresponds to the bottommost arrow, which only
state 3 has in its ancestry, the second state to the rightmost of the
top arrows, and the third state to the leftmost top arrow. This coding
will guarantee that the number of times that states arise on the tree
(in programs MIX, MOVE, PENNY and BOOT) or the number of polymorphic
states in a tree segment (in the Polymorphism option of DOLLOP,
DOLMOVE, DOLPENNY and DOLBOOT) will correctly correspond to what would
have been the case had our programs been able to take multistate
characters into account. Although I have shown the above character
state tree as rooted, the recoding method works equally well on
unrooted multistate characters as long as the connections between the
states are known and contain no loops.

<p>
However, in the default option of programs DOLLOP, DOLMOVE,
DOLPENNY and DOLBOOT the multistate recoding does not necessarily work
properly, as it may lead the program to reconstruct nonexistent state
combinations such as 010. An example of this problem is given in my
paper on alternative phylogenetic methods (1979).

<p>
If you have multistate character data where the states are connected
in a branching "character state tree" you may want to do the binary
recoding yourself. Thanks to Christopher Meacham, the package contains
a program, FACTOR, which will do the recoding itself. For details see
the documentation file for FACTOR.

<p>
We now also have the program PARS, which can do parsimony for
unordered character states.

<b>fdolmove</b> output:

<p>

If the A option is used, then the program will infer, for any
character whose ancestral state is unknown ("?") whether the ancestral
state 0 or 1 will give the fewest changes (according to the criterion
in use). If these are tied, then it may not be possible for the
program to infer the state in the internal nodes, and many of these
will be shown as "?". If the A option is not used, then the program
will assume 0 as the ancestral state.

<p>
When reconstructing the placement of forward changes and reversions
under the Dollo method, keep in mind that each polymorphic state in
the input data will require one "last minute" reversion. This is
included in the counts. Thus if we have both states 0 and 1 at a tip
of the tree the program will assume that the lineage had state 1 up to
the last minute, and then state 0 arose in that population by
reversion, without loss of state 1.

<p>
When DOLMOVE calculates the number of characters compatible with the
tree, it will take the F option into account and count the multistate
characters as units, counting a character as compatible with the tree
only when all of the binary characters corresponding to it are
compatible with the tree.
