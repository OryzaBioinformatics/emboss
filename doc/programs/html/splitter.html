Split a sequence into (overlapping) smaller sequences


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


	This simple editing program allows you to split a long sequence
	into smaller, optionally overlapping, subsequences. 

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>


	To split a sequence into sub-sequences of 10,000 bases (the
	default size) with no overlap between the sub-sequences:

<pre>
	% splitter one_huge.seq many_small.seq
</pre>

	To split a sequence into sub-sequences of 50,000 bases with an
	overlap of 3,000 bases on each sub-sequence. 

<pre>
	% splitter one_huge.seq many_small.seq -size=50000 -over=3000
</pre>

<H2>
    Input File Format
</H2>


	One or more sequences

<H2>
    Output File Format
</H2>



	Many sequences.
<p>
	The names of the sequences are the same as the original
	sequence, with '_start-end' appended, where 'start', and 'end' are the
	start and end positions of the sub-sequence. eg:
	The name HSHBB would be changed in the sub-sequences to:
	HSHBB_1-50000 and HSHBB_50001-73308 if they were split at the
	size of 50000 with no overlap. 

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>


	None.	

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>


	There should be little requirement to split sequences into
	smaller sub-sequences in EMBOSS, but there may be circumstances where
	memory usage becomes restrictive when dealing with truly large
	sequences.

href="mailto:gwilliam@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk">(gwilliam@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk)</a>

<H2>
    History
</H2>


	Completed 22 March 1999
<br>

	23 May 2001 - Gary Williams - changed the overlap so that the
start of a new sequence section is one more than the split-point, the
end is the split-point plus the overlap.  e.g.  splitting at 10000 with
an overlap of 100 gives: 1-10100, 10001-20100, etc.
