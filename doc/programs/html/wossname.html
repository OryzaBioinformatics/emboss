Finds programs by keywords in their one-line documentation


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This allows a user to search for keywords or parts of words in the
brief documentation (as displayed by a program when it first starts).
The program name and the brief description is output.  If no words to
search for are specified, then details of all the EMBOSS programs are
output.

<p>

The program has been written on the assumption that most people will
use it to quickly find the name of a program based on that program's
description, so the output goes to the screen by default.

<p>

This program may find some use in automatically generating lists of
EMBOSS programs and their groups for Web pages.

                                  all programs will be listed.

   Optional qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -explode            boolean    The groups that EMBOSS applications belong
                                  to have two forms, exploded and not

                                  non-exploded ones. The exploded names are
                                  formed from definitions of the group names
                                  that start like NAME1:NAME2 and which are
                                  then expanded into many combinations of the

                                  For example, if you wish the program name to

                                  http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/programname.html
                                  then if you enter

                                  here, then the first half of the URL before
                                  the programname will be set.
*  -postlink           string     If you are outputting to a file in HTML

                                  half of the URL.
                                  For example, if you wish the program name to

                                  then if you enter '.html' here, the second
                                  half of the URL after the programname will

                                  descriptions instead of the programs being

If the -html, -prelink and -postlink qualifiers are specified, then
the output will be wrapped in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web
page.  Note that tags such as &lt;HTML&gt;, &lt;BODY&gt;,
&lt;/BODY&gt; and &lt;/HTML&gt; are not output by this program as the
list of programs is expected to form only part of the contents of a
web page - the rest of the web page must be supplied by the user.

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>


As noted above, the program ACD files are searched.
The average user will not need to worry about this.


<H2>
    Notes
</H2>


If a program's ACD file does not assign the program to a group,
it will be automatically assigned to the group 'ASSORTED'.

<p>

A program can belong to more than one group.

<p>

The name of this program comes from its use as a favorite word of the
author Terry Pratchett.  It is used especially by the characters of the
parrot in <b>Eric</b> and the dog <i>Gaspode</i> in <b>Moving
Pictures</b> and <b>Men at Arms</b>.
