Finds programs by keywords in their one-line documentation


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This allows a user to search for keywords or parts of words in the
brief documentation (as displayed by a program when it first starts).
The program name and the brief description is output.  If no words to
search for are specified, then details of all the EMBOSS programs are
output.

<p>

The program has been written on the assumption that most people will
use it to quickly find the name of a program based on that program's
description, so the output goes to the screen by default.

<p>

This program may find some use in automatically generating lists of
EMBOSS programs and their groups for Web pages.

                                  in the one-line documentation of all of the

                                  all programs will be listed.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -explode            boolean    The groups that EMBOSS applications belong
                                  to have two forms, exploded and not
                                  exploded. The exploded group names are more
                                  numerous and often vaguely phrased than the
                                  non-exploded ones. The exploded names are
                                  formed from definitions of the group names
                                  that start like NAME1:NAME2 and which are
                                  then expanded into many combinations of the
                                  names as: 'NAME1', 'NAME2', 'NAME1 NAME2',
                                  NAME2 NAME1'. The non-expanded names are
                                  simply like: 'NAME1 NAME2'.
   -outfile            outfile    Output file name

                                  this will format it for displaying as a
                                  table in a WWW document.
*  -prelink            string     If you are outputting to a file in HTML

                                  hyper-links by setting this to be the first
                                  half of the URL.
                                  For example, if you wish the program name to
                                  be a hyperlink to the URL:
                                  http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/programname.html
                                  then if you enter
                                  http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/
                                  here, then the first half of the URL before
                                  the programname will be set.
*  -postlink           string     If you are outputting to a file in HTML
                                  format, you can make the program names into
                                  hyper-links by setting this to be the second
                                  half of the URL.
                                  For example, if you wish the program name to
                                  be a hyperlink to the URL:
                                  http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/programname.html
                                  then if you enter '.html' here, the second
                                  half of the URL after the programname will
                                  be set.
   -groups             boolean    If you use this option, then only the group
                                  names will output to the file
   -alphabetic         boolean    If you use this option, then you will get a
                                  single list of the program names and
                                  descriptions instead of the programs being
                                  listed in their functional groups.

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -[no]emboss         boolean    If you use this option then EMBOSS program
                                  documentation will be searched. If this
                                  option is set to be false, then only the
                                  EMBASSY programs will be searched (if the
                                  -embassy option is true). EMBASSY programs
                                  are not strictly part of EMBOSS, but use the
                                  same code libraries and share the same look
                                  and feel, but are generally developed by
                                  people who wish the programs to be outside
                                  of the GNU Public Licence sheme, ie. they
                                  may wish to charge money for them.
   -[no]embassy        boolean    If you use this option then EMBASSY program
                                  documentation will be searched. If this
                                  option is set to be false, then only the
                                  EMBOSS programs will be searched (if the
                                  -emboss option is true). EMBASSY programs

                                  may wish to charge money for them.
   -colon              boolean    The groups that EMBOSS applications belong
                                  to up to two levels, for example the primary
                                  group 'ALIGNMENT' has several sub-groups,
                                  or second-level groups, e.g.: CONSENSUS,
                                  DIFFERENCES, DOT PLOTS, GLOBAL, LOCAL,
                                  MULTIPLE. To aid programs that parse the
                                  output of wossname that require the names of
                                  these subgroups, a colon ':' will be placed
                                  between the first and second level of the
                                  group name if this option is true. Note:
                                  This does not apply if the group names have
                                  been exploded with the 'explode' option.
   -gui                boolean    This option is intended to help those who

                                  the EMBOSS applications. Some EMBOSS
                                  programs are inappropriate for running in a
                                  GUI, these include other menu programs and
                                  interactive editors. This option allows you
                                  to only report those programs that can be

expect - don't worry about them unless you are writing EMBOSS

If the -html, -prelink and -postlink qualifiers are specified, then
the output will be wrapped in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web
page.  Note that tags such as &lt;HTML&gt;, &lt;BODY&gt;,
&lt;/BODY&gt; and &lt;/HTML&gt; are not output by this program as the
list of programs is expected to form only part of the contents of a
web page - the rest of the web page must be supplied by the user.

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>


As noted above, the program ACD files are searched.
The average user will not need to worry about this.


<H2>
    Notes
</H2>


If a program's ACD file does not assign the program to a group,
it will be automatically assigned to the group 'ASSORTED'.

<p>

A program can belong to more than one group.

<p>

The name of this program comes from its use as a favorite word of the
author Terry Pratchett.  It is used especially by the characters of the
parrot in <b>Eric</b> and the dog <i>Gaspode</i> in <b>Moving
Pictures</b> and <b>Men at Arms</b>.
