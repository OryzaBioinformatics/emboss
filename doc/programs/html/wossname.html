<H2>
    Function
</H2>

Finds programs by keywords in their one-line documentation


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This allows a user to search for keywords or parts of words in the
brief documentation (as displayed by a program when it first starts).
The program name and the brief description is output.  If no words to
search for are specified, then details of all the EMBOSS programs are
output.

<p>

The program has been written on the assumption that most people will
use it to quickly find the name of a program based on that program's
description, so the output goes to the screen by default.

<p>

This program may find some use in automatically generating lists of
EMBOSS programs and their groups for Web pages.

<H2>
    Usage

                                  that start like NAME1:NAME2 and which are
