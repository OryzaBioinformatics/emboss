<b>yank</b> is a simple utility to add a specified sequence name to a
list file. 

<p>

In fact, it writes out not just the name of the sequence, but also the
start and end position of a region within that sequence and, if the
sequence is nucleic, if can specify whether the sequence is the reverse
complement. 

<p>

Many EMBOSS programs can read in a set of sequences.  (Some examples are
<b>emma</b> and <b>union</b>) There are many ways of specifying these
sequences, including wildcarded sequence file names, wildcarded database
entry names and list files.  List files (files of file names) are the
most flexible. <b>yank</b> is a utility to add sequences to a list file.

<p>


Instead of containing the sequences themselves, a List file contains
"references" to sequences - so, for example, you might include database
entries, the names of files containing sequences, or even the names of
other list files.  For example, here's a valid list file, called
<i>seq.list</i>:

<p>
<pre>
unix % more seq.list 

opsd_abyko.fasta
sw:opsd_xenla
sw:opsd_c*
@another_list
</pre>

<p>

This looks a bit odd, but it's really very straightforward; the file
contains:

<p>

<ul>
      <li><b>opsd_abyko.fasta</b> - this is the name of a sequence file. The file is read in from the current directory. 
      <li><b>sw:opsd_xenla</b> - this is a reference to a specific sequence in the SwissProt database 
      <li><b>sw:opsd_c*</b> - this represents all the sequences in SwissProt whose identifiers start with ``opsd_c'' 
      <li><b>another_list</b> - this is the name of a second list file 
</ul>

<p>

Notice the <b>@</b> in front of the last entry.  This is the way you tell
EMBOSS that this file is a list file, not a regular sequence file. 

<p>

Without the program <b>yank</b> you would need to use a text editor such
as pico to create the appropriate list files.  <b>yank</b>
makes this process easy. 




<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.
 -->


Here is a sample session with yank, adding the regions making up the
coding sequence of embl:hsfau1 to the list 'cds.list':

<pre>

% yank
Reads a range from a sequence, appends the full USA to a list file
Input sequence: em:hsfau1
     Begin at position [start]: 782
       End at position [end]: 856
        Reverse strand [N]:
Output file [hsfau1.yank]: cds.list

% yank
Reads a range from a sequence, appends the full USA to a list file
Input sequence: em:hsfau1
     Begin at position [start]: 951
       End at position [end]: 1095
        Reverse strand [N]:
Output file [hsfau1.yank]: cds.list

% yank
Reads a range from a sequence, appends the full USA to a list file
Input sequence: em:hsfau1
     Begin at position [start]: 1557
       End at position [end]: 1612
        Reverse strand [N]:
Output file [hsfau1.yank]: cds.list

% yank
Reads a range from a sequence, appends the full USA to a list file
Input sequence: em:hsfau1
     Begin at position [start]: 1787
       End at position [end]: 1912
        Reverse strand [N]:
Output file [hsfau1.yank]: cds.list

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

Any valid sequence can be read in.

<p>

You will be prompted for the start and end positions you wish to use.

<p>

If the sequence is nucleic, you will be prompted whether you wish to use
the reverse complement of the sequence. 








<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 
   -->

The result file 'cds.list' of the example above is:

<p>

<pre>
em-id:HSFAU1[782:856]
em-id:HSFAU1[951:1095]
em-id:HSFAU1[1557:1612]
em-id:HSFAU1[1787:1912]     
</pre>


<p>

This can now be read in by a program such as <b>union</b> by specifying
the list file as '@cds.list' when <b>union</b> prompts for
input. 














<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
<p>

None.
