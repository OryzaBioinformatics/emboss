<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
        Algorithms
  -->

<b>seqretsplit</b> is exactly the same as the program <b>seqret</b>
except that when it writes out more than one sequence, it writes each
sequence to an individual file. 
<P>

Its main use is therefore to split a file containing multiple sequences
into many files, each containing one sequence. 
<p>

The names of the files it creates are derived from the ID name of the
sequence, followed by an extension denoting the format of the sequence. 
You have no control over the names of the files it writes out. 
<P>

For example, if the files <i>embl:hsfa11*</i> are read in and the
output is specified as <i>wibble.seq</i>, then the following files are
expected to be created:
<P>

<pre>
hsfa110.fasta
hsfa111.fasta
hsfa112.fasta
hsfa113.fasta
hsfa114.fasta
</pre>
<p>
(No file <i>wibble.seq</i> is created.)
<p>

Why would you want to split a multiple sequence file into many
individual files? 
<p>

EMBOSS programs can read in many sequences from one file where this is
sensible.  Sometimes EMBOSS programs can only read in one sequence at a
time because that is the sensible way to do things, but your sequence is
one sequence of many in a file.  You can specify that sequence using the
USA <i>filename:sequenceID</i>, but you may still feel more comfortable
splitting your sequences up into many files first.
<p>

Many non-EMBOSS programs will also have restrictions on whether they can
read in multiple sequence files or not.
<p>


<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.
 -->


Here is a sample session with seqretsplit:

<pre>

% seqretsplit
Reads and writes (returns) sequences in individual files
Input sequence(s): embl:hsfa11*
Output sequence [hsfa110.fasta]:
</pre>
<p>

The specification of the output file is not used in this case.
<p>

At some point this ought to change and you will not be prompted for the
output file at all. 
<p>

    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

Normal sequence USA.





<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 
   -->


One file for each input sequence is written out.
<p>

The names of the files it creates are derived from the ID name of the
sequence, followed by an extension denoting the format of the sequence. 
You have no control over the names of the files it writes out. 
<P>

For example, if the files <i>embl:hsfa11*</i> are read in and the
output is specified as <i>wibble.seq</i>, then the following files are
expected to be created:
<P>

<pre>
hsfa110.fasta
hsfa111.fasta
hsfa112.fasta
hsfa113.fasta
hsfa114.fasta
</pre>
<p>
(No file <i>wibble.seq</i> is created.)

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
<p>

None.

<!-- 
        Bugs noted but not yet fixed.

It shouldn't really prompt for the output filename.
