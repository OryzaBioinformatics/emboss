Displays a non-overlapping wordmatch dotplot of two sequences

    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.

        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will
        do what he wants. 

        Long description.

        Why it is useful.

        When it should/shouldn't be used.

        Algorithms

        Expanded description.

        eg: Reverse engineers Wheedle's 'talpsgob' program. This does a 
        splurge of the 5' end of the sequence followed by a durm.
        The net effect is a 5' end splurt.
        etc. for as long as is required (several pages is not unreasonable)
  -->

A dotplot is a graphical representation of the regions of similarity
between two sequences. 
<P>

The two sequences are placed on the axes of a rectangular image and
wherever there is a similarity between the sequences a dot is placed on
the image. 
<P>

Where the two sequences have substantial regions of similarity, many
dots align to form diagonal lines.  It is therefore possible to see at a
glance where there are local regions of similarity. 
<P>

<b>dotpath</b> is very similar to the program <b>dottup</b> which looks
for places where words (tuples) of a specified length have an exact
match in both sequences and draws a diagonal line over the position of
these words.
<P>


Using a longer word size thus displays less random noise, runs
extremely quickly, but is less sensitive. 
<P>

<b>dotpath</b> finds all matches of size <b>-wordsize</b> or greater
between two sequences.  It then reduces the matches found to the minimal
set of long matches that do not overlap.  This is a way of finding the
(nearly) optimal path aligning two sequences.  It is not the true
optimal path as produced by the algorithms used in <b>water</b> or
<b>needle</b>, but for very closely related sequences it will produce
the same result and will work well with very long sequences. 
<P>

If you wish to compare the path found by <b>dotpath</b> to the set of
all matches found then the qualifier <b>-overlaps</b> will show all
matches in red except for the matches in the minimal path which are
shown in black, as normal. 

<H2>
    Usage

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

	blank lines and comment lines are ignored.
        comment lines start with '#'
        There are three columns separated by one or more space or TAB
	characters for X and Y values of durm, followed by energy
        all coefficients are given as floating point values

<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

<!-- 
        Potentially stupid things the program will let you do.
        eg:
        It doesn't check to see if the sequence is a protein sequence or not.
   -->

If you give a small word size with a very large sequence you will run
out of memory.  If this happens, try again with a larger word size. 

<H2>
    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

<!-- 
        Error messages specific to this program.
        eg:

        "Threshold value greater than 1." - means that the threshold has
        been set to be greater than 1 but a burgle exception has
        occurred making this invalid - you should reduce the wobble
        parameter and try again.
