    Description

<b>scopalign</b> parses a SCOP classification file in EMBL-like format
generated by the EMBOSS applications <b>scope</b> or <b>nrscope</b>, and
domain coordinate files generated by the EMBOSS application <b>domainer</b>,
and calls <b>stamp</b> to generate structural alignments for each SCOP family
in turn. 

<p>

<h2>VERY IMPORTANT NOTE</h2>

<b>scopalign</b> will only run with with a version of <b>stamp</b> which has
been modified so that PDB ID codes of length greater than 4 characters
are acceptable.  This involves a trivial change to the <b>stamp</b> module
getdomain.c (around line number 155), a 4 must be changed to a 7 as
follows: 
<br>
temp=getfile(domain[0].id,dirfile,4,OUTPUT);
<br>
temp=getfile(domain[0].id,dirfile,7,OUTPUT);

<p>

The modified code is kept on the HGMP file system in /packages/stamp/src2
WHEN RUNNING SCOPALIGN AT THE HGMP IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE COMMAND 
'use stamp2' (which runs the script /packages/menu/USE/stamp2) IS GIVEN 
BEFORE SCOPALIGN IS RUN.  This will ensure that the modified version of 
stamp is used.

    Usage

	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->


<b>scopalign</b> parses a SCOP classification file in EMBL-like format
generated by the EMBOSS applications <b>scope</b> or <b>nrscope</b>, and
domain coordinate files generated by the EMBOSS application <b>domainer</b>.











<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 
   -->

The names of the output files are identical to the names of the families
given in the SCOP classification records, except that if a file of a 
certain name already exists, then an "_1", "_2" etc will be added as 
appropriate.

<p>

The format of the <b>scopalign</b> output file (Figure 1) is similar to
the output file generated by stamp when issued with the following three
types of command:

<p>

(1) stamp -l ./stamps_file.dom -s -n 2 -slide 5 -prefix ./stamps_file -d 
./stamps_file.set;sorttrans -f ./stamps_file.scan -s Sc 2.5 > 
./stamps_file.sort;stamp -l ./stamps_file.sort -prefix ./stamps_file > 
./stamps_file.log

<p>

(2) poststamp -f ./stamps_file.3 -min 0.5

<p>
 
(3) ver2hor -f ./stamps_file.3.post > ./stamps_file.out

<p>

However, the SCOP classification records for the appopriate family are 
written above the alignment, no dssp assignments are given, and only the
'Post similar' line is given. Also, 7 character domain identifier codes 
taken from the scop classificaiton file are given.

<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored

<pre>
% embossdata -showall

To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

    Notes
</H2>

<!-- 
        Restrictions.
        Interesting behaviour.
        Useful things you can do with this program.
   -->

<b>scopalign</b> will only run with with a version of <b>stamp</b> which has
been modified so that PDB ID codes of length greater than 4 characters
are acceptable.  This involves a trivial change to the <b>stamp</b> module
getdomain.c (around line number 155), a 4 must be changed to a 7 as
follows: 
<br>
temp=getfile(domain[0].id,dirfile,4,OUTPUT);
<br>
temp=getfile(domain[0].id,dirfile,7,OUTPUT);

<p>

The modified code is kept on the HGMP file system in /packages/stamp/src2
WHEN RUNNING SCOPALIGN AT THE HGMP IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE COMMAND 
'use stamp2' (which runs the script /packages/menu/USE/stamp2) IS GIVEN 
BEFORE SCOPALIGN IS RUN.  This will ensure that the modified version of 
stamp is used.
