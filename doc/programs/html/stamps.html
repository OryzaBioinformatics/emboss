    Description

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
        Algorithms
  -->

<b>stamps</b> parses a SCOP classification file in EMBL-like format
generated by the EMBOSS applications <b>scope</b> or <b>nrscope</b>, and
<b>domain</b> coordinate files generated by the EMBOSS application
<b>domainer</b>, and calls stamp to generate structural alignments for
each SCOP family in turn. 

<p>

<h2>VERY IMPORTANT NOTE</h2>

<B>stamps</B> will only run with with a version of stamp which has been
modified so that pdb id codes of length greater than 4 characters are
acceptable.  This involves a trivial change to the stamp module
getdomain.c (around line number 155), a 4 must be changed to a 7 as
follows: 
<BR>
temp=getfile(domain[0].id,dirfile,4,OUTPUT);
<BR>
temp=getfile(domain[0].id,dirfile,7,OUTPUT);

<P>

The modified code is kept on the HGMP file system in /packages/stamp/src2
WHEN RUNNING STAMPS AT THE HGMP IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE COMMAND 
'use stamp2' (which runs the script /packages/menu/USE/stamp2) IS GIVEN 
BEFORE STAMPS IS RUN.  This will ensure that the modified version of 
stamp is used.

    Usage

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->















<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 
   -->

The names of the output files are identical to the names of the families
given in the SCOP classification records, except that if a file of a 
certain name already exists, then an "_1", "_2" etc will be added as 
appropriate.

<p>

The format of the stamps output file (Figure 1) is similar to the output
file generated by stamp when issued with the following three types of 
command:

<p>

(1) stamp -l ./stamps_file.dom -s -n 2 -slide 5 -prefix ./stamps_file -d 
./stamps_file.set;sorttrans -f ./stamps_file.scan -s Sc 2.5 > 
./stamps_file.sort;stamp -l ./stamps_file.sort -prefix ./stamps_file > 
./stamps_file.log

<p>

(2) poststamp -f ./stamps_file.3 -min 0.5

<p>

(3) ver2hor -f ./stamps_file.3.post > ./stamps_file.out

<p>

However, the SCOP classification records for the appopriate family are 
written above the alignment, no dssp assignments are given, and only the
'Post similar' line is given. Also, 7 character domain identifier codes 
taken from the scop classificaiton file are given.

    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
