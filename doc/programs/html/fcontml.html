<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Estimates phylogenies from gene frequency data by maximum likelihood
under a model in which all divergence is due to genetic drift in the
absence of new mutations. Does not assume a molecular clock. An
alternative method of analyzing this data is to compute Nei's genetic
distance and use one of the distance matrix programs. This program can
also do maximum likelihood analysis of continuous characters that
evolve by a Brownian Motion model, but it assumes that the characters
evolve at equal rates and in an uncorrelated fashion, so that it does
not take into account the usual correlations of characters.


<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


This program estimates phylogenies by the restricted maximum
likelihood method based on the Brownian motion model. It is based on
the model of Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza (1964; Cavalli-Sforza and
Edwards, 1967). Gomberg (1966), Felsenstein (1973b, 1981c) and
Thompson (1975) have done extensive further work leading to efficient
algorithms. CONTML uses restricted maximum likelihood estimation
(REML), which is the criterion used by Felsenstein (1973b). The actual
algorithm is an iterative EM Algorithm (Dempster, Laird, and Rubin,
1977) which is guaranteed to always give increasing likelihoods. The
algorithm is described in detail in a paper of mine (Felsenstein,
1981c), which you should definitely consult if you are going to use
this program. Some simulation tests of it are given by Rohlf and
Wooten (1988) and Kim and Burgman (1988).
<p>

The default (gene frequency) mode treats the input as gene frequencies
at a series of loci, and square-root-transforms the allele frequencies
(constructing the frequency of the missing allele at each locus
first). This enables us to use the Brownian motion model on the
resulting coordinates, in an approximation equivalent to using
Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards's (1967) chord measure of genetic distance
and taking that to give distance between particles undergoing pure
Brownian motion. It assumes that each locus evolves independently by
pure genetic drift.

<p>
The alternative continuous characters mode (menu option C) treats the
input as a series of coordinates of each species in N dimensions. It
assumes that we have transformed the characters to remove correlations
and to standardize their variances.


<h3>A word about microsatellite data</h3>

<p>
Many current users of CONTML use it to analyze microsatellite
data. There are three ways to do this: 

<ul>

<li>
Coding each copy number as an allele, and feeding in the frequencies
of these alleles. As CONTML's gene frequency mode assumes that all
change is by genetic drift, this means that no copy number arises by
mutation during the divergence of the populations. Since
microsatellite loci have very high mutation rates, this is
questionable.

<li>
Use some other program, one not in the PHYLIP package, to compute
distances among the populations. Some of the programs that can do this
are RSTCalc, poptrfdos, Microsat, and Populations. Links to them can
be found at my Phylogeny Programs web site at
http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip/software.html.

<p>
Those distance measures allow for mutation during the divergence of
the populations. But even they are not perfect -- they do not allow us
to use all the information contained in the gene frequency differences
of within a copy number allele. There is a need for a more complete
statistical treatment of inference of phylogenies from microsatellite
models, ones that take both mutation and genetic drift fully into
account.

<li>
Alternatively, there is the Brownian motion approximation to mean
population copy number. This is described in my book (Felsenstein,
2004, Chapter 15, pp. 242-245), and it is implicit also in the
microsatellite distances. Each locus is coded as a single continuous
character, the mean of the copy number in at that microsatellite locus
in that species. Thus if the species (or population) has frequencies
0.10, 0.24, 0.60, and 0.06 of alleles that have 18, 19, 20, and 21
copies, it is coded as having

<p>
<pre>
0.10 X 18 + 0.24 X 19 + 0.60 X 20 + 0.06 X 21   =  19.62 
</pre>

<p>
copies. These values can, I believe, be calculated by a spreadsheet
program. Each microsatellite is represented by one character, and the
continuous character mode of CONTML is used (not the gene frequencies
mode). This coding allows for mutation that changes copy number. It
does not make complete use of all data, but neither does the treatment
of microsatellite gene frequencies as changing only genetic
drift. frequency

<b>fcontml</b> reads continuous character data.


<h3>Continuous character data</h3>
The programs in this group use gene frequencies and quantitative
character values. One (CONTML) constructs maximum likelihood estimates
of the phylogeny, another (GENDIST) computes genetic distances for use
in the distance matrix programs, and the third (CONTRAST) examines
correlation of traits as they evolve along a given phylogeny.

<p>
When the gene frequencies data are used in CONTML or GENDIST, this
involves the following assumptions:

<ol>

<li>
Different lineages evolve independently. 

<li>
After two lineages split, their characters change independently. 

<li>
Each gene frequency changes by genetic drift, with or without mutation
(this varies from method to method).

<li>
Different loci or characters drift independently. 

</ol>

<p>
How these assumptions affect the methods will be seen in my papers on
inference of phylogenies from gene frequency and continuous character
data (Felsenstein, 1973b, 1981c, 1985c).


<p>
The input formats are fairly similar to the discrete-character
programs, but with one difference. When CONTML is used in the
gene-frequency mode (its usual, default mode), or when GENDIST is
used, the first line contains the number of species (or populations)
and the number of loci and the options information. There then follows
a line which gives the numbers of alleles at each locus, in
order. This must be the full number of alleles, not the number of
alleles which will be input: i. e. for a two-allele locus the number
should be 2, not 1. There then follow the species (population) data,
each species beginning on a new line. The first 10 characters are
taken as the name, and thereafter the values of the individual
characters are read free-format, preceded and separated by
blanks. They can go to a new line if desired, though of course not in
the middle of a number. Missing data is not allowed - an important
limitation. In the default configuration, for each locus, the numbers
should be the frequencies of all but one allele. The menu option A
(All) signals that the frequencies of all alleles are provided in the
input data -- the program will then automatically ignore the last of
them. So without the A option, for a three-allele locus there should
be two numbers, the frequencies of two of the alleles (and of course
it must always be the same two!). Here is a typical data set without
the A option:

<p>
<pre>
     5    3
2 3 2
Alpha      0.90 0.80 0.10 0.56
Beta       0.72 0.54 0.30 0.20
Gamma      0.38 0.10 0.05  0.98
Delta      0.42 0.40 0.43 0.97
Epsilon    0.10 0.30 0.70 0.62
</pre>
 


<p>
whereas here is what it would have to look like if the A option were invoked: 

<p>
<pre>
     5    3
2 3 2
Alpha      0.90 0.10 0.80 0.10 0.10 0.56 0.44
Beta       0.72 0.28 0.54 0.30 0.16 0.20 0.80
Gamma      0.38 0.62 0.10 0.05 0.85  0.98 0.02
Delta      0.42 0.58 0.40 0.43 0.17 0.97 0.03
Epsilon    0.10 0.90 0.30 0.70 0.00 0.62 0.38

</pre> 


<p>
The first line has the number of species (or populations) and the
number of loci. The second line has the number of alleles for each of
the 3 loci. The species lines have names (filled out to 10 characters
with blanks) followed by the gene frequencies of the 2 alleles for the
first locus, the 3 alleles for the second locus, and the 2 alleles for
the third locus. You can start a new line after any of these allele
frequencies, and continue to give the frequencies on that line
(without repeating the species name).

<p>
If all alleles of a locus are given, it is important to have them add
up to 1. Roundoff of the frequencies may cause the program to conclude
that the numbers do not sum to 1, and stop with an error message.

<p>
While many compilers may be more tolerant, it is probably wise to make
sure that each number, including the first, is preceded by a blank,
and that there are digits both preceding and following any decimal
points.

<p>
CONTML and CONTRAST also treat quantitative characters (the
continuous-characters mode in CONTML, which is option C). It is
assumed that each character is evolving according to a Brownian motion
model, at the same rate, and independently. In reality it is almost
always impossible to guarantee this. The issue is discussed at length
in my review article in Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics
(Felsenstein, 1988a), where I point out the difficulty of transforming
the characters so that they are not only genetically independent but
have independent selection acting on them. If you are going to use
CONTML to model evolution of continuous characters, then you should at
least make some attempt to remove genetic correlations between the
characters (usually all one can do is remove phenotypic correlations
by transforming the characters so that there is no within-population
covariance and so that the within-population variances of the
characters are equal -- this is equivalent to using Canonical
Variates). However, this will only guarantee that one has removed
phenotypic covariances between characters. Genetic covariances could
only be removed by knowing the coheritabilities of the characters,
which would require genetic experiments, and selective covariances
(covariances due to covariation of selection pressures) would require
knowledge of the sources and extent of selection pressure in all
variables.

<p>
CONTRAST is a program designed to infer, for a given phylogeny that is
provided to the program, the covariation between characters in a data
set. Thus we have a program in this set that allow us to take
information about the covariation and rates of evolution of characters
and make an estimate of the phylogeny (CONTML), and a program that
takes an estimate of the phylogeny and infers the variances and
covariances of the character changes. But we have no program that
infers both the phylogenies and the character covariation from the
same data set.

<p>
In the quantitative characters mode, a typical small data set would be: 

<p>
<pre>
     5   6
Alpha      0.345 0.467 1.213  2.2  -1.2 1.0
Beta       0.457 0.444 1.1    1.987 -0.2 2.678
Gamma      0.6 0.12 0.97 2.3  -0.11 1.54
Delta      0.68  0.203 0.888 2.0  1.67
Epsilon    0.297  0.22 0.90 1.9 1.74

</pre>


<p>
Note that in the latter case, there is no line giving the numbers of
alleles at each locus. In this latter case no square-root
transformation of the coordinates is done: each is assumed to give
directly the position on the Brownian motion scale.

<p>
For further discussion of options and modifiable constants in CONTML,
GENDIST, and CONTRAST see the documentation files for those programs.

<b>fcontml</b> output has a standard appearance. The topology of the
tree is given by an unrooted tree diagram. The lengths (in time or in
expected amounts of variance) are given in a table below the topology,
and a rough confidence interval given for each length. Negative lower
bounds on length indicate that rearrangements may be acceptable.

<p>
The units of length are amounts of expected accumulated variance (not
time). The log likelihood (natural log) of each tree is also given,
and it is indicated how many topologies have been tried. The tree does
not necessarily have all tips contemporary, and the log likelihood may
be either positive or negative (this simply corresponds to whether the
density function does or does not exceed 1) and a negative log
likelihood does not indicate any error. The log likelihood allows
various formal likelihood ratio hypothesis tests. The description of
the tree includes approximate standard errors on the lengths of
segments of the tree. These are calculated by considering only the
curvature of the likelihood surface as the length of the segment is
varied, holding all other lengths constant. As such they are most
probably underestimates of the variance, and hence may give too much
confidence in the given tree.

<p>
One should use caution in interpreting the likelihoods that are
printed out. If the model is wrong, it will not be possible to use the
likelihoods to make formal statistical statements. Thus, if gene
frequencies are being analyzed, but the gene frequencies change not
only by genetic drift, but also by mutation, the model is not
correct. It would be as well-justified in this case to use GENDIST to
compute the Nei (1972) genetic distance and then use FITCH, KITSCH or
NEIGHBOR to make a tree. If continuous characters are being analyzed,
but if the characters have not been transformed to new coordinates
that evolve independently and at equal rates, then the model is also
violated and no statistical analysis is possible. Doing such a
transformation is not easy, and usually not even possible.

<p>
If the U (User Tree) option is used and more than one tree is
supplied, the program also performs a statistical test of each of
these trees against the one with highest likelihood. If there are two
user trees, the test done is one which is due to Kishino and Hasegawa
(1989), a version of a test originally introduced by Templeton
(1983). In this implementation it uses the mean and variance of
log-likelihood differences between trees, taken across loci. If the
two trees means are more than 1.96 standard deviations different then
the trees are declared significantly different. This use of the
empirical variance of log-likelihood differences is more robust and
nonparametric than the classical likelihood ratio test, and may to
some extent compensate for the any lack of realism in the model
underlying this program.

<p>
If there are more than two trees, the test done is an extension of the
KHT test, due to Shimodaira and Hasegawa (1999). They pointed out that
a correction for the number of trees was necessary, and they
introduced a resampling method to make this correction. The version
used here is a multivariate normal approximation to their test; it is
due to Shimodaira (1998). The variances and covariances of the sum of
log likelihoods across loci are computed for all pairs of trees. To
test whether the difference between each tree and the best one is
larger than could have been expected if they all had the same expected
log-likelihood, log-likelihoods for all trees are sampled with these
covariances and equal means (Shimodaira and Hasegawa's "least
favorable hypothesis"), and a P value is computed from the fraction of
times the difference between the tree's value and the highest
log-likelihood exceeds that actually observed. Note that this sampling
needs random numbers, and so the program will prompt the user for a
random number seed if one has not already been supplied. With the
two-tree KHT test no random numbers are used.

<p>
In either the KHT or the SH test the program prints out a table of the
log-likelihoods of each tree, the differences of each from the highest
one, the variance of that quantity as determined by the log-likelihood
differences at individual sites, and a conclusion as to whether that
tree is or is not significantly worse than the best one.

<p>
One problem which sometimes arises is that the program is fed two
species (or populations) with identical transformed gene frequencies:
this can happen if sample sizes are small and/or many loci are
monomorphic. In this case the program "gets its knickers in a twist"
and can divide by zero, usually causing a crash. If you suspect that
this has happened, check for two species with identical
coordinates. If you find them, eliminate one from the problem: the two
must always show up as being at the same point on the tree anyway.
