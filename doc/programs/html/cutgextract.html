    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
  -->


given the name of a directory containing the
   CUTG database  (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/cutg) this
   will calculate codon usage tables for individual species
   (e.g. EHomo_sapiens.cut) and place them in the CODONS subdirectory
   of the EMBOSS data directory. This is an all-or-nothing extraction,
   will create many files and take several minutes. The usage tables
   are from the sum of codons over all sequences for each organism.
                          

Given the name of a directory containing the CUTG database
(ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/cutg) <b>cutgextract</b> will
calculate codon usage tables for individual species (e.g. 
EHomo_sapiens.cut) and place them in the CODONS subdirectory of the
EMBOSS data directory.  This is an all-or-nothing extraction, will
create many files and take several minutes.  The usage tables are from
the sum of codons over all sequences for each organism. 
             
<p>


The EMBOSS distribution comes loaded with a set of codon usage tables. 
Thes codon usage tables provided with the distribution are calculated
from the files in <a
href="ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/codonusage/README">
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/codonusage/README</a>), with a few
additions whose exact derivation cannot easily be determined.  Many
people would prefer to create their own from the public CUTG data. 

<p>


You run <b>cutgextract</b> on the CUTG database from <a
href="ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/cutg">
ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/cutg</a>.  You should get all the
required *.codon files from CUTG, and uncompress them if they are
compressed before running <b>cutgextract</b> on them. 

<p>

The task of downloading the CUTG database and running <b>cutgextract</b>
to create the codon usage table files from it would normally be done
only once when the EMBOSS package is being installled or if a new
version of the CUTG database is released. 



<p>

Note by the way that CUTG has a drawback:  it has a table for each organism
without making the distinction between different gene populations.

<p>










<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

<!-- 
        Algorithms
	  Pseudocode/Vague description/Handwaving/web links to useful pages
  -->

<b>cutgextract</b> looks in the specified directory and opens all the
files with the extension '.codon'.  These are all expected to be CUTG
data files. 

<p>

It then parses out the codon usage data from these *.codon files and
writes one file per species into the EMBOSS data/CODONS directory.  The
names of the files are derived from the species names in the CUTG files. 
These files names will be long (and therefore descriptive). 












<H2>
    Usage

	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
