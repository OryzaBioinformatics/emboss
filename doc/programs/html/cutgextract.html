<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
