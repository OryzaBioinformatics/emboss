    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
        Algorithms
  -->

Nearly all proteins have structural similarities with other proteins
and, in some of these cases, share a common evolutionary origin.  A
knowledge of these relationships is crucial to our understanding of the
evolution of proteins and of development.  It will also play an
important role in the analysis of the sequence data that is being
produced by worldwide genome projects. 

<p>

The 
<A HREF="http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/">SCOP</A> 
database aims to provide a detailed and comprehensive
description of the structural and evolutionary relationships between all
proteins whose structure is known, including all entries in the Protein
Data Bank 
(<A HREF="http://pdb-browsers.ebi.ac.uk//">PDB</A>).  

<p>

<b>domainer</b> reads in an EMBL-like format SCOP classification file
generated by the EMBOSS applications 
<a href="scope.html"><b>scope</b></a>
or 
<a href="nrscope.html"><b>nrscope</b></a>, 
and EMBL-like format clean protein coordinate files generated by the
<a href="coorde.html"><b>coorde</b></a> application. 

(not currently in EMBOSS, email Jon Ison 
<a href="mailto:jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk">jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk</a>) 

For each domain in the scop classification file <b>domainer</b> writes clean
domain coordinate files in EMBL-like and PDB formats.  
Each of these output files contains coordinates for a single SCOP domain.  In
cases where multiple models were determined, the data in the domain
files correspond to the first model.  
In the rare cases where a domain
is comprised of more than one chain, the data will be presented as
belonging to a single chain (i.e.  a single sequence, chain identifier
etc will be given). 













<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->


The EMBL-like format used for the input clean protein data (and the output
domain format) uses the following records:

<p>

(1)  ID - Either the 4-character PDB identifier code (for clean protein 
coordinate files) or the 7-character domain identifier code taken from scop
(for domain coordinate files; see documentation for the EMBOSS application 
<a href="scope.html"><b>scope</b></a> 
for further info.)
<p>

(2)  DE - compound information.  Text from the COMPND records from the 
original pdb file are given.
<p>

(3)  OS - protein source information.  Text from the SOURCE records from the 
original pdb file are given.
<p>

(4)  EX - experimental information. The text 'nmr_or_model' (for nuclear  
magnetic resonance and model structures) or 'xray' (for structures 
determined by X-ray crystallography) appears as appropriate after the text
'METHOD'.  The resolution of X-ray structures, or '0' for structures of type
'nmr_or_model', is given after 'RESO'.  The number of models and number of 
polypeptide chains are given after 'NMOD' and 'NCHA' respectively. For 
domain coordinate files a 1 is always given. Following the EX record, the 
file will have a section containing a CN, IN and SQ records (see below) for
each chain.
<p>

(5)  CN - chain number.  The number given in brackets after this record 
indicates the start of a section of chain-specific data.
<p>

(6)  IN - chain specific data. The character given after ID is the PDB chain 
identifier (a '.' is given in cases where a chain identifier was not 
specified in the pdb file or, for domain coordinate files, the domain is 
comprised of more than one domain).  The number of amino acid residues 
comprising the chain (or the chains from which a domain is comprised) is 
given after NR. The number of atoms in heterogens and water molecules are 
given after NH and NW respectively. Domain coordinate files do not include
coordinates for these groups so a value of 0 is always given.
<p>

(7)  SQ - protein sequence. The number of residues is given before AA on the
first line. The protein sequence is given on subsequent lines. 
<p>

(8)  CO - coordinate data.  The columns of the records are as follows.
<OL>
<LI>CO is always given.
<LI>Model number (always 1 for domain coordinate files).
<LI>Chain number (always 1 for domain coordinate files).
<LI>Either P (a protein atom), H (a heterogen atom) or W (an atom in a water molecule).
<LI>Position of the residue in the protein sequence given in the SQ record (for protein atoms) or a sequential count of the atoms (for heterogens and water).
<LI>Residue number according to the original pdb file, or or a sequential count of the atoms (for heterogens and water).
<LI>Single character amino acid code or a '.' (for heterogens and water).
<LI>3-character residue identifier code.
<LI>Atom type.
<LI>The x orthogonal coordinate.
<LI>The y orthogonal coordinate.
<LI>The z orthogonal coordinate.
<LI>Occupancy.
<LI>Temperature factor.
</OL>
<p>

(9)  XX - Used for spacing.
<p>

(10) // - Given on the last line of the file only.
<p>








<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 
   -->

The PDB format is explained at:

http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/docs/format/pdbguide2.2/guide2.2_frame.html</A>
<br>

<b>domainer</b> writes the following records in PDB format:
<p>

(1)  HEADER - bibliographic information.  The text 'CLEANED-UP PDB FILE FOR 
SCOP DOMAIN XXXXXXX' is always given (where XXXXXXX is a 7-character domain 
identifier code).
<p>

(2)  TITLE - bibliographic information. The text ' THIS FILE IS MISSING 
MOST RECORDS FROM THE ORIGINAL PDB FILE' is always given.
<p>

(3)  COMPND - compound information.  The COMPND records from the original  
pdb file are given.
<p>

(4)  SOURCE - protein source information.  The SOURCE records from the 
original PDB file are given.
<p>

(5)  REMARK - remark records. Remark records are used for spacing. One 
REMARK line containing the protein resolution is always given.
<p>

(6)  SEQRES - protein sequence.  
<p>

(7)  ATOM - atomic coordinates.
<p>

(8)  TER - indicates the end of a chain.

<p>

The following is an example of an excerpt from an output clean domain
coordinate file (PDB format):

<b>domainer</b> generates a log file, an excerpt of which is shown below. 
If there is a problem in processing a domain, three lines containing the

in cases where a clean coordinate file could not be found.  'ERROR
filename file read error' or 'ERROR filename file write error' will be
reported when an error was encountered during a file read or write
