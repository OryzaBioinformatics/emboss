<b>whichdb</b> searches all available EMBOSS databases for sequences
with a specified ID name or accession number.

<p>

EMBOSS does not allow database entries to be specified by just the ID
name or accession number.  You must specify both the name of the
database and the entry, for example 'embl:hsfau', not just 'hsfau'. 

<p>

If you do not know which database(s) contain the entry you are
interested in, <b>whichdb</b> will tell you.

<p>

<b>whichdb</b> can also, optionally, write out the sequences it finds to
files. 

<H3>IDs and Accessions</H3>

An entry in a database must have some way of being uniquely identified
in that database.  Most sequence databases have two such identifiers for
each sequence - an ID name and an Accession number. 

<p>

Why are there two such identifiers? The ID name was originally intended
to be a human-readable name that had some indication of the function of
its sequence.  In EMBL and GenBank the first two (or three) letters
indicated the species and the rest indicated the function, for example
'hsfau' is the 'Homo Sapiens FAU pseudogene'.  This naming scheme
started to be a problem when the number of entries added each day was so
vast that people could not make up the ID names fast enough.  Instead,
the Accession numbers were used as the ID name.  Therefore you will now
find ID names like 'AF061303', the same as the Accession number for that
sequence in EMBL. 

<p>

ID names are not guaranteed to remain the same between different
versions of a database (although in practice they usually do). 

<p>

Accession numbers are unique alphanumeric identifiers that are
guaranteed to remain with that sequence through the rest of the life of
the database.  If two sequences are merged into one, then the new
sequence will get a new Accession number and the Accession numbers of
the merged sequences will be retained as 'secondary' Accession numbers. 

<p>

EMBL, GenBank and SwissProt share an Accession numbering scheme - an
Accession number uniquely identifies a sequence within these three
databases. 







<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.
 -->


Here is a sample session with whichdb:

<pre>

% whichdb
Search all databases for an entry
ID or Accession number: hsfau
Output file [outfile.whichdb]: 

</pre>







<H2>
    Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-entry]             string     ID or Accession number
*  -outfile            outfile    Output file name

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -get                boolean    Retrieve sequences

   General qualifiers:
  -help                boolean    Report command line options. More

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

None.













<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 
   -->

The reported database entries are written out to the specified output file.

<p>

The results from the above example follow:

<p>

<hr>
<pre>
embl:hsfau
human:hsfau
tembl:hsfau
em:hsfau
genbank:hsfau
gb:hsfau   
</pre>
<hr>

<p>

Each database that is defined in the local implementation of EMBOSS
which contains an entry called 'hsfau' is reported.

<p>

Note that where a database is defined under several names ('embl',
'em'), each definition of that database containing the entry is
reported. 

<p>

When the '-get' option is used to output the sequences, they are written
to separate files.  The sequence format they are written in is always
'Fasta' format.  The normal command-line qualifiers for changing the
output formats etc.  will not work in this program. 

<p>

The names of the files that the sequences are written to is reported as
they are written, for example:

<p>
<hr>
<pre>
Writing hsfau.embl
Writing hsfau.human
Writing hsfau.tembl
Writing hsfau.em
Writing hsfau.genbank
Writing hsfau.gb
</pre>
<hr>








<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
