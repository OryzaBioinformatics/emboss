Strips out DNA between a pair of vector sequences

    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.

        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will
        do what he wants. 

        Long description.

        Why it is useful.

        When it should/shouldn't be used.

        Algorithms

        Expanded description.

        eg: Reverse engineers Wheedle's 'talpsgob' program. This does a 
        splurge of the 5' end of the sequence followed by a durm.
        The net effect is a 5' end splurt.
        etc. for as long as is required (several pages is not unreasonable)
  -->

<b>vectorstrip</b> is intended to be useful for stripping vector sequence
from the ends of sequences of interest. For example, if a fragment has
been cloned into a vector and then sequenced, the sequence may contain
vector data eg from the cloning polylinker at the 5' and 3' ends of
the sequence.  <b>vectorstrip</b> will remove these contaminating regions and
output trimmed sequence ready for input into another application.

<p>

<b>vectorstrip</b> is suitable for use with low quality sequence data as it
can allow for mismatches between the sequence and the vector patterns
provided. You can specify the maximum level of mismatch
expected.
<p>
Vector data can either be provided in a file or interactively. If
presented in a file, <b>vectorstrip</b> will search all input sequences with
all vectors listed in that file. The intention is that the user can
maintain a single file for use with <b>vectorstrip</b>, containing all the
linker sequences commonly used in the laboratory.

<p>
The two patterns for each vector are searched separately against the
sequence. Once the search is completed, each of the hits of the 5'
sequence is paired with each of the hits of the 3' sequence and the
resulting subsequences are output. For example, if the 5' sequence
matches the sequence from (a) position 30-60, and(b)position 70-100,
and the 3' sequence matches from 150-175, then two subsequences will
be output: from 61-149, and from 101-149. The lower the quality of
the sequence, the more likely multiple hits become if nonzero
mismatches are accepted.

<p>
Default behaviour is to report only the best matches between the
vector patterns and the sequence. This means that if you
specify a maximum mismatch level of 10%, but the vector patterns
match the sequence with zero mismatches, the search will stop and the
program will output only these "best" matches. If there are no perfect
matches, the program will try searching again allowing 1 mismatch,
then 2, and so on until either the patterns match the sequence or the
maximum specified mismatch level is exceeded. You can tell <b>vectorstrip</b>
to show all possible matches up to your specified maximum level, as
illustrated in the examples below.

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

The same fragment has been cloned into the XhoI site of the polylinker
of each vector.  The cloned fragment is represented in lower case and
the vector sequence in upper case so the sequence trimming can be
readily seen. 

<p>


Each line of the vector file should contain the name of the vector, the
5' pattern and the 3' pattern. 

<br>

Lines beginning with # are treated as comments and ignored.

<br>

If only one vector sequence is given in the it will be assumed that 
this is the 5' pattern.

<br>

If a vector name is given but no pattern data, the vector will not 
be used.

        eg:

If you wish to include the standard description of what data files
are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve them, use:

<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>

<li><pre>Illegal pattern</pre> indicates that one of the vector patterns could not be compiled and therefore cannot be searched.
<li><pre>5' and 3' sequence matches are identical; inconclusive</pre> indicates that the 5' and 3' patterns provided were identical, and that they only match the sequence once. Thus the program cannot determine which part of the sequence is vector and which is insert.
