    Description
</H2>

For nucleic acid sequence data on four species, computes Lake's and
Cavender's phylogenetic invariants, which test alternative tree
topologies. The program also tabulates the frequencies of occurrence
of the different nucleotide patterns. Lake's invariants are the method
which he calls "evolutionary parsimony".


<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


<p>
This program reads in nucleotide sequences for four species and
computes the phylogenetic invariants discovered by James Cavender
(Cavender and Felsenstein, 1987) and James Lake (1987). Lake's method
is also called by him "evolutionary parsimony". I prefer Cavender's
more mathematically precise term "invariants", as the method bears
somewhat more relationship to likelihood methods than to
parsimony. The invariants are mathematical formulas (in the present
case linear or quadratic) in the EXPECTED frequencies of site patterns
which are zero for all trees of a given tree topology, irrespective of
branch lengths. We can consider at a given site that if there are no
ambiguities, we could have for four species the nucleotide patterns
(considering the same site across all four species) AAAA, AAAC, AAAG,
... through TTTT, 256 patterns in all.

<p>
The invariants are formulas in the expected pattern frequencies, not
the observed pattern frequencies. When they are computed using the
observed pattern frequencies, we will usually find that they are not
precisely zero even when the model is correct and we have the correct
tree topology. Only as the number of nucleotides scored becomes
infinite will the observed pattern frequencies approach their
expectations; otherwise, we must do a statistical test of the
invariants.

<p>
Some explanation of invariants will be found in the above papers, and
also in my recent review article on statistical aspects of inferring
phylogenies (Felsenstein, 1988b). Although invariants have some
important advantages, their validity also depends on symmetry
assumptions that may not be satisfied. In the discussion below suppose
that the possible unrooted phylogenies are I: ((A,B),(C,D)), II:
((A,C),(B,D)), and III: ((A,D),(B,C)).


<h3>Lake's Invariants, Their Testing and Assumptions</h3>

<p>
Lake's invariants are fairly simple to describe: the patterns involved
are only those in which there are two purines and two pyrimidines at a
site. Thus a site with AACT would affect the invariants, but a site
with AAGG would not. Let us use (as Lake does) the symbols 1, 2, 3,
and 4, with the proviso that 1 and 2 are either both of the purines or
both of the pyrimidines; 3 and 4 are the other two nucleotides. Thus 1
and 2 always differ by a transition; so do 3 and 4. Lake's invariants,
expressed in terms of expected frequencies, are the three quantities:
<p>
<pre>
(1)      P(1133) + P(1234) - P(1134) - P(1233), 

(2)      P(1313) + P(1324) - P(1314) - P(1323), 

(3)      P(1331) + P(1342) - P(1341) - P(1332), 
</pre>

<p>
He showed that invariants (2) and (3) are zero under Topology I, (1)
and (3) are zero under topology II, and (1) and (2) are zero under
Topology III. If, for example, we see a site with pattern ACGC, we can
start by setting 1=A. Then 2 must be G. We can then set 3=C (so that 4
is T). Thus its pattern type, making those substitutions, is
1323. P(1323) is the expected probability of the type of pattern which
includes ACGC, TGAG, GTAT, etc.

<p>
Lake's invariants are easily tested with observed frequencies. For
example, the first of them is a test of whether there are as many
sites of types 1133 and 1234 as there are of types 1134 and 1233; this
is easily tested with a chi-square test or, as in this program, with
an exact binomial test. Note that with several invariants to test, we
risk overestimating the significance of results if we simply accept
the nominal 95% levels of significance (Li and Guoy, 1990).

<p>
Lake's invariants assume that each site is evolving independently, and
that starting from any base a transversion is equally likely to end up
at each of the two possible bases (thus, an A undergoing a
transversion is equally likely to end up as a C or a T, and similarly
for the other four bases from which one could start. Interestingly,
Lake's results do not assume that rates of evolution are the same at
all sites. The result that the total of 1133 and 1234 is expected to
be the same as the total of 1134 and 1233 is unaffected by the fact
that we may have aggregated the counts over classes of sites evolving
at different rates.


<h3>Cavender's Invariants, Their Testing and Assumptions</h3>

<p>
Cavender's invariants (Cavender and Felsenstein, 1987) are for the
case of a character with two states. In the nucleic acid case we can
classify nucleotides into two states, R and Y (Purine and Pyrimidine)
and then use the two-state results. Cavender starts, as before, with
the pattern frequencies. Coding purines as R and pyrimidines as Y, the
patterns types are RRRR, RRRY, and so on until YYYY, a total of 16
types. Cavender found quadratic functions of the expected frequencies
of these 16 types that were expected to be zero under a given
phylogeny, irrespective of branch lengths. Two invariants (called K
and L) were found for each tree topology. The L invariants are
particularly easy to understand. If we have the tree topology
((A,B),(C,D)), then in the case of two symmetric states, the event
that A and B have the same state should be independent of whether C
and D have the same state, as the events determining these happen in
different parts of the tree. We can set up a contingency table:

<p>
<pre>
                                 C = D         C =/= D
                           ------------------------------
                          |
                   A = B  |   YYYY, YYRR,     YYYR, YYRY,
                          |   RRRR, RRYY      RRYR, RRRY
                          |
                 A =/= B  |   YRYY, YRRR,     YRYR, YRRY,
                          |   RYYY, RYRR      RYYR, RYRY
</pre>
<p>
and we expect that the events C = D and A = B will be
independent. Cavender's L invariant for this tree topology is simply
the negative of the crossproduct difference,

<p>
<pre>
      P(A=/=B and C=D) P(A=B and C=/=D) - P(A=B and C=D) P(A=/=B and C=/=D). 
</pre>

<p>
One of these L invariants is defined for each of the three tree
topologies. They can obviously be tested simply by doing a chi-square
test on the contingency table. The one corresponding to the correct
topology should be statistically indistinguishable from zero. Again,
there is a possible multiple tests problem if all three are tested at
a nominal value of 95%.

<p>
The K invariants are differences between the L invariants. When one of
the tables is expected to have crossproduct difference zero, the other
two are expected to be nonzero, and also to be equal. So the
difference of their crossproduct differences can be taken; this is the
K invariant. It is not so easily tested.

<p>
The assumptions of Cavender's invariants are different from those of
Lake's. One obviously need not assume anything about the frequencies
of, or transitions among, the two different purines or the two
different pyrimidines. However one does need to assume independent
events at each site, and one needs to assume that the Y and R states
are symmetric, that the probability per unit time that a Y changes
into an R is the same as the probability that an R changes into a Y,
so that we expect equal frequencies of the two states. There is also
an assumption that all sites are changing between these two states at
the same expected rate. This assumption is not needed for Lake's
invariants, since expectations of sums are equal to sums of
expectations, but for Cavender's it is, since products of expectations
are not equal to expectations of products.

<p>
It is helpful to have both sorts of invariants available; with further
work we may appreciate what other invaraints there are for various
models of nucleic acid change.

<b>fdnainvar</b> output consists first (if option 1 is selected) of a
reprinting of the input data, then (if option 2 is on) tables of
observed pattern frequencies and pattern type frequencies. A table
will be printed out, in alphabetic order AAAA through TTTT of all the
patterns that appear among the sites and the number of times each
appears. This table will be invaluable for computation of any other
invariants. There follows another table, of pattern types, using the
1234 notation, in numerical order 1111 through 1234, of the number of
times each type of pattern appears. In this computation all sites at
which there are any ambiguities or deletions are omitted. Cavender's
invariants could actually be computed from sites that have only Y or R
ambiguities; this will be done in the next release of this program.

<p>
If option 3 is on the invariants are then printed out, together with
their statistical tests. For Lake's invariants the two sums which are
expected to be equal are printed out, and then the result of an
one-tailed exact binomial test which tests whether the difference is
expected to be this positive or more. The P level is given (but
remember the multiple-tests problem!).

<p>
For Cavender's L invariants the contingency tables are given. Each is
tested with a one-tailed chi-square test. It is possible that the
expected numbers in some categories could be too small for valid use
of this test; the program does not check for this. It is also possible
that the chi-square could be significant but in the wrong direction;
this is not tested in the current version of the program. To check it
beware of a chi-square greater than 3.841 but with a positive
invariant. The invariants themselves are computed, as the difference
of cross-products. Their absolute magnitudes are not important, but
which one is closest to zero may be indicative. Significantly nonzero
invariants should be negative if the model is valid. The K invariants,
which are simply differences among the L invariants, are also printed
out without any test on them being conducted. Note that it is possible
to use the bootstrap utility SEQBOOT to create multiple data sets, and
from the output from sunning all of these get the empirical
variability of these quadratic invariants.

This program is an EMBOSS conversion of a program written by Joe
Felsenstein as part of his PHYLIP package.

<p>
Although we take every care to ensure that the results of the EMBOSS
version are identical to those from the original package, we recommend
that you check your inputs give the same results in both versions
before publication.

<p>
Please report all bugs in the EMBOSS version to the EMBOSS bug team,
not to the original author.
