<b>tranalign</b> is a re-implementation in EMBOSS of the program
<b>mrtrans</b> by Bill Pearson. 

<p>



<b>tranalign</b> is a simple program that allows you to produce aligned
cDNA sequences from aligned protein sequences.  This can be very useful
for phylogeny programs, e.g.  in PHYLIP - dnadist, dnapars, dnaml, etc. 
In general, it is better to use protein sequences for multiple
alignments, but to use DNA sequences for phylogeny.  This can be time
consuming when there are gaps in the aligned protein sequences. 

<p>

<b>tranalign</b> takes a set of (unaligned) nucleic sequences and a set of
<i>aligned</i> protein sequences.  It reads the first nucleic sequence
and the first protein sequence, translates the nucleic sequence in each of the
three forward frames, compares the protein sequence to the translated nucleic
sequence to find the protein coding region, and then writes out the nucleic
sequence that encoded the protein.  

<p>

The sequences must be in the same order in both sets of sequences.  A
common problem you should be aware of is that some alignment program
(including clustalw/<b>emma</b>) will re-order the aligned sequences to
group similar sequences together. 

<p>

The protein library may include '-' characters to specify alignments. 
Each '-' character in the protein library is ignored during the sequence
comparison but replaced by '---' in the nucleic sequence output to form the aligned nucleic sequences. 

<p>

<b>tranalign</b> finds the coding regions for contiguous sequences only. 
It will not splice together different exons to produce a coding
sequence.  You should therefore use either mRNA sequences, or nucleic
sequences which you have constructed to hold a contiguous coding region
(maybe using <b>extractseq</b> or <b>yank</b> and <b>union</b>?).

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

The input is a set of unaligned nucleic sequences and the set of aligned
protein sequences to be used as a guide in the alignment of the output
nucleic sequences. 

<p>

The ID names of the nucleic acid and protein sequences are NOT checked
to see if they correspond to each other.  They can have any names. 


<p>

There must be at least as many protein sequences as nucleic acid
sequence - extra protein sequences are ignored. 

<p>

Each of the nucleic acid sequences must have a corresponding protein
sequence which is derived from the coding region of that nucleic acid
sequence. The two sets of sequences must be in the same order.







<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 
   -->

The output is the regions of the nucleic acid sequences which code for
the corresponding protein sequence, with gap characters ('-') introduced
so that they have the same alignment as the corresponding protein
sequences. 
















<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>

None.

<!-- 
        Restrictions.
        Interesting behaviour.
        Useful things you can do with this program.
   -->



The sequences must be in the same order in both sets of sequences.  A
common problem you should be aware of is that some alignment program
(including clustalw/<b>emma</b>) will re-order the aligned sequences to
group similar sequences together.

None.







<H2>
    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

<!-- 
        Error messages specific to this program, eg:
        "FATAL xxx" - means you have not set up the xxx data using program <b>prog</b>.<p>
   -->

"No guide protein sequence available for nucleic sequence xxx" - the
corresponding protein sequence for this nucleic sequence has not been
input. You have input more nucleic acid sequences than protein sequences.

<p>


"Guide protein sequence xxx not found in nucleic sequence xxx" - the
region of the nucleic sequence which codes for the protein was not
found.  The coding region in the nucleic acid sequence must be a single
contiguous sequence.  The protein sequence might not be the
corresponding one for this nucleic acid sequence if they are out of
order.

    Exit status

<!-- 
        Description of the exit status for various error conditions

It always exits with status 0.
