    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.

  -->

<b>biosed</b> is a simple sequence editing utility that searches for a
target subsequence in one or more input sequences and replaces it with a
specified second subsequence (or optionally just deletes the found
target subsequence). 

<p>

<b>biosed</b> was inspired by the useful UNIX utility <b>sed</b> which
searches for a pattern in text and can replace or delete the found
pattern. 

<p>

If the target subsequence occurs more than once, then each instance of
the target is replaced. 

<p>

The target subsequence is not any sort of an ambiguity pattern, it is
just a short sequence.  A simple string match is done and if it exactly
matches then the replacement is done.  The matching is independent of
the case of the sequence or the target - both uppercase and lowercase
will match. 






<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.
 -->


Here is a sample session with biosed:

<p>

Replace all 'T's with 'U's to create a RNA sequence
<p>
<pre>
% biosed em:hsfau hsfau.rna -target T -replace U
</pre>

<p>

Replace all 'RGD' protein motifs with 'XXRGDXX'
<p>
<pre>
% biosed sw:A4M1_HUMAN A4M1_HUMAN.pep -target RGD -replace XXRGDXX 
</pre>

    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

It reads the USA of one or more nucleic acid or protein sequences.












<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 
   -->

The edited sequence is output.

<P>

The sequence will be in uppercase.

















<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
<p>

None.

    Notes
</H2>

<!-- 
        Restrictions.
        Interesting behaviour.
        Useful things you can do with this program.
   -->

The edited sequence will be output in uppercase.

    References
</H2>

<!-- 
        Bibliography for methods used.
   -->

None.








<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

<!-- 
        Potentially stupid things the program will let you do.
   -->

No check is made on the replacement subsequence.  
<br> 
Any text can be used as the replacement, including characters only used
in proteins (e.g.  D, E, F, etc.), characters not used in proteins (e.g. 
J, O, etc), digits and punctuation characters. 







<H2>
    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

<!-- 
        Error messages specific to this program, eg:
        "FATAL xxx" - means you have not set up the xxx data using program <b>prog</b>.<p>

None.







<H2>
    Exit status
</H2>

<!-- 
        Description of the exit status for various error conditions
   -->

It always exits with status 0.
