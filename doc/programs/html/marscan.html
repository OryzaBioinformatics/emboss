Matrix/scaffold attachment regions (MARs/SARs) are genomic elements
thought to delineate the structural and functional organisation of the
eukaryotic genome.  Originally, MARs and SARs were identified through
their ability to bind to the nuclear matrix or scaffold.  Binding cannot
be assigned to a unique sequence element, but is dispersed over a region
of several hundred base pairs.  These elements are found flanking a gene
or a small cluster of genes and are located often in the vicinity of
cis-regulatory sequences.  This has led to the suggestion that they
contribute to higher order regulation of transcription by defining
boundaries of independently controlled chromatin domains.  There is
indirect evidence to support this notion.  In transgenic experiments
MARs/SARs dampen position effects by shielding the transgene from the
effects of the chromatin structure at the site of integration. 
Furthermore, they may act as boundary elements for enhancers,
restricting their long range effect to only the promoters that are
located in the same chromatin domain. 

<p>

<b>marscan</b> finds a bipartite sequence element that is unique for a
large group of eukaryotic MARs/SARs.  This MAR/SAR recognition signature
(<b>MRS</b>) comprises two individual sequence elements that are <200 bp
apart and may be aligned on positioned nucleosomes in MARs.  The MRS can
be used to correctly predict the position of MARs/SARs in plants and
animals, based on genomic DNA sequence information alone.  Experimental
evidence from the analysis of >300 kb of sequence data from several
eukaryotic organisms show that wherever a MRS is observed in the DNA
sequence, the corresponding genomic fragment is a biochemically
identifiable SAR. 

<p>

The MRS is a bipartite sequence element that consists of two individual
sequences of 8 (AATAAYAA) and 16 bp (AWWRTAANNWWGNNNC) within a 200 bp
distance from each other.  One mismatch is allowed in the 16 bp pattern. 
The patterns can occur on either strand of the DNA with respect to each
other. The 8 bp and the 16 bp sites can overlap.

<p>

Where there are many possible MRS sites caused by many 8 bp and/or 16 bp
pattern sites located within 200 bp of each other, then only the 8 bp
site and the 16 bp site that occur closest to each other are reported. 

<p>

Once a MRS has been reported, no more sites will be looked for within
200 bp of that site.  This reduces (but maybe will not totally
eliminate) over-reporting of the clusters of MRS's that tend to occur
within a MAR/SAR. 


<p>

Not all SARs contain a MRS.  Analysis of >300 kb of genomic sequence
from a variety of eukaryotic organisms shows that the MRS faithfully
predicts 80% of MARs and SARs, suggesting that at least one other type
of MAR/SAR may exist which does not contain a MRS.

<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall

To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
