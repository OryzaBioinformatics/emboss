<b>siggen</b> parses a multiple structure alignment generated by the
EMBOSS application <b>scopalign</b> and corresponding files of residue contact
data generated by the EMBOSS application <b>contacts</b> and generates a
protein signature of a specified sparsity. 

<p>

Each position in the alignment is scored on the basis of a single or any
combination of up to 3 scoring schemes.  A signature of, for example,
10% sparsity would include data from the top 10% highest scoring
alignment positions. 

<p>

The resulting protein signature file is used by the application
<b>sigscan</b> to find examples of the signature in other proteins. 


<h3>Signatures</h3>


Signatures extend the comcept of the motif as a tool for characterizing
protein families.  They consist of a set of N key residue postitions
(A1, A2 ...An) preceeded by gaps (G) thus G1A1G2A2...GnAn.  Both a
residue and a gap can be variable.  A signature is matched to a protein
sequence and scored using a dynamic programming algorithm which permits
variability in gap distance and residue type.  Generating a signature
involves identifying residues associated with points of contact in
interactions between secondary structure alements.  A raw signature
consists of a set of positions with potential key structural roles
sampled from a sequence alignment constructed with reference to this
contact data.  Raw signatures are refined by samplinfg different
gap-residue pairs until the specificity of a signature for the family
cannot be further improved.

    Input file format

        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc.

<b>siggen</b> reads in multiple structure alignment generated by the
EMBOSS application <b>scopalign</b> and corresponding files of residue
contact data generated by the EMBOSS application <b>contacts</b>. 













<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 
   -->

The output file (Figure 1) uses the following records.
The four SCOP classification records are taken from the alignment input file:

<p>

<ol>
<li>CL - Domain class.  It is identical to the text given after 'Class' in 
the scop classification file (see documentation for the EMBOSS application 
scope). 

<li>FO - Domain fold.  It is identical to the text given after 'Fold' in 
the scop classification file (see scope documentation). 

<li>SF - Domain superfamily.  It is identical to the text given after 
'Superfamily' in the scop classification file (see scope documentation). 

<li>FA - Domain family. It is identical to the text given after 'Family' in 
the scop classification file (see scope documentation). 

<li>NP - Number of signature positions.

<li>NN - Signature position number.  The number given in brackets after 
this record indicates the start of the data for the relevent signature positi
on.

<li>IN - Informative line about signature position. The number of different 
amino acid residues seen for this position is given after 'NRES', the number 
of different sizes of gap follows 'NGAP', and the window size after 'WSIZ'.
When a signature is aligned to a protein sequence, the permissible gaps between 
two signature positions is determined by the empirical gaps and the window 
size for the C-terminal position (see sigscan.c)
Two rows of data for the emprical residues and gaps are then given:

<li>AA - The identifier of a residue seen in this position and the frequency
of its occurence are delimited by ';'.

<li>GA - The size of a gap seen in this position and the frequency 
of its occurence are delimited by ';'.

<li>// - used to delimit data for each signature. The last line of a file 
always  contains '//' only.
</ol>

<p>

Important

<p>

<ol>

<li>In the case a signature file is generated by hand, it is essential
that the gap data given is listed in order of increasing gap size. 

<li>In the current implementation, window size records always have the
value of 0.  These should be changed manually unless a very rigid
pattern is required.  A future implementation will provide a range of
methods for generating values of window size depending upon the
alignment (window size is identified by the WSIZ record in the signature
output file). 

<li>Siggen presumes that standard SCOP domain identifiers are given in
the input alignment if the id is 7 characters long and the first
character is a 'd' or 'D'.  In this case the contact data for that chain
will be parsed.  Otherwise contact data for chain 1 will be parsed.

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.

   -->

<b>siggen</b> reads in a protein residue comparison matrix.  By default,
this is EBLOSUM62. 

<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
