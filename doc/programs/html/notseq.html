<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
        Algorithms
  -->

When you have a set of sequences (a file of multiple sequences?) and you
wish to remove one or more of them from the set, then use <b>notseq</b>. 

<p>

This program was written for the case where a file containing several
sequences is being used as a small database, but some of the sequences
are no longer required and must be deleted from the file. 

<p>

<b>notseq</b> splits the input sequences into those that you wish to
keep and those you wish to exclude. 

<p>

<b>notseq</b> takes a set of sequences as input together with a list of
sequence names or accession numbers.  It also takes the name of a new
file to write the files that you want to keep into, and optionally the
name of a file that will contain the files that you want excluded from
the set. 

<p>

<b>notseq</b> then reads in the input sequences.  It outputs the ones
that match one of the sequence names or acession numbers to the file of
excluded sequences, and those that don't match are output to the file of
sequences to be kept. 








<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.
 -->


Here is a sample session with notseq.  In this case the excluded
sequences ('clone186' and 'clone876') are simply thrown away and not
saved to any file. 
<p>

<pre>
% notseq
Input sequence(s): mydata.seq
Output sequence [clone001.fasta]: mydata2.seq
Sequence names to exclude: clone186, clone876
</pre>


Here is an example where the sequences to be excluded are saved to
another file:
<p>

<pre>
% notseq -junkout excluded.seq
Input sequence(s): mydata.seq
Output sequence [clone001.fasta]: mydata2.seq
Sequence names to exclude: clone99*
</pre>

                                  in. The excluded sequences will be written

                                  have excluded from the main output file of
                                  sequences.

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata

It exits with a status of 0 unless no matches are found to any of the
