Protein proteolytic enzyme or reagent cleavage digest


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


<b>digest</b> finds the positions where a specified proteolytic enzyme
or reagent might cut a peptide sequence. 

<p>

This programs allows you to input a protein sequence and to specify one
proteolytic agent from a list.  It will then output a file containing
the positions where the agent cuts, together with the peptides produced. 

<p>

Trypsin will not normally cut after a K if it is followed by (e.g.)
another K or a P.  Specifying the qualifier <b>-unfavoured</b> shows
those cuts.  as well as the favoured ones. 

<p>

If you wish to emulate a partial digestion, then using the
<b>-overlap</b> qualifier will display the results from a digest in
which all cut sites are used and in which one site at a time is not cut. 
Thus the resulting peptide fragments from the cut sites numbered 1, 2,
3, 4 etc.  are shown, plus the fragments produced by cutting at the
sites 1..3, 2..4, etc. 

<p>

i.e. fragments containing one potential cut site are also shown.

<p>

If you wish to emulate a <b>very</b> partial digestion (!) then using
the <b>-allpartials</b> qualifier will do what <b>-overlap</b> did, but
also show all possible fragments from using all possible combinations of
cut sites.  For example, fragments from the cut sites numbered 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 and from the fragments produced by cutting between sites 1..3,
1..4, 1..5, 2..4, 2..5, 3..5, etc. 

<p>

i.e. fragments containing one or more potential cut site are also shown.


<H2>
    Usage

The first non-blank line is the title containing the name of the program
and the name o fthe input sequence with the range considered and the
calculated molecular weight of the protein. 

<p>
The next non-blank line gives the name of the reagent used to digest the
protein and the number of fragments reported.  The line will report is
complete or partial digestion was chosen.  If the protein is not
digested at all by the reagent chosen the following is reported: 

<pre>
"Is not proteolytically digested using (reagent name)"
</pre>

<p>
If '-overlap' was specified, the next line will be:

<pre>
"Only overlapping partials shown:"
</pre>

<p>
If '-allpartials' was specified, the next line will be:

<pre>
"All partials shown:"
</pre>


<p>
The next non-blank line gives the headings of the columns of data.

<p>
The rest of the file consists of columns holding the following data:

<ul>
<li> The start position of the fragment
<li> The end position of the fragment
<li> The residue before the cut site (in brackets)
<li> The sequence of the fragment.  If the fragment is longer than 38
	residues then the sequence reported is truncated to 38 residues and
	'...' is in the last column
<li> The residue after the second cut site (in brackets)
<li> If the fragment is longer than 38 then '...' is in the last column,
	else this is blank.
