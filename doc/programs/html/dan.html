Calculates DNA RNA/DNA melting temperature


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


Dan calculates the melting temperature (Tm) and the percent G+C of a
nucleic acid sequence (optionally plotting them).  For the Melting
temperature profile, free energy values calculated from nearest neighbor
thermodynamics are used (Breslauer et al.  Proc.  Natl.  Acad.  Sci. 
USA 83, 3746-3750 and Baldino et al.  Methods in Enzymol.  168,
761-777). 

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>


Here is a sample session with dan.

<pre>

% dan
Input sequence: embl:paamir
Enter window size [20]: 
Enter Shift Increment [1]: 
Enter DNA concentration (nM) [50.]: 
Enter salt concentration (mM) [50.]: 
Output file [paamir.dan]: 

</pre>

An example of producing a plot of Tm:

<pre>

% dan -plot
Input sequence(s): embl:paamir
Enter window size [20]: 
Enter Shift Increment [1]: 
Enter DNA concentration (nM) [50.]: 
Enter salt concentration (mM) [50.]: 
Enter minimum temperature [55.]: 
Graph type [x11]:

If a plot is not being produced, dan reports the sequence of each
oligomer window, its melting temperature under the specified conditions
and its GC content. 

<p>
This is the start of the output file from the example. 

<pre>

DAN of: PAAMIR   from: 1  to: 2167

   8 CTGGCCGAGCATCTGCTCGA   27 Tm=63.7 GC%=65.0
etc.

</pre>

<p>
The first non-blank line is the title containing the program name, the
sequence name and the start and end positions of the sequence to be
considered. 

<p>
Subsequent lines contain columns of data for each window into the
sequence as it is moved along, giving:

<p>
<ul>
<li> The start postion of the window
<li> The sequence of the window
<li> The end position of the window
<li> The melting temperature of the window
<li> The percentage C+G of the window
</ul>

<p>
If the qualifier '-product' is used to make the program prompt for
percent formamide percent of mismatches allowed and product length, then
the output includes the melting temperature of the specified product:

<pre>

DAN of: PAAMIR   from: 1  to: 2167

   1 GGTACCGCTGGCCGAGCATC   20 Tm=64.9 GC%=70.0 Tm(prod)=54.9
   2 GTACCGCTGGCCGAGCATCT   21 Tm=63.7 GC%=65.0 Tm(prod)=52.8
   3 TACCGCTGGCCGAGCATCTG   22 Tm=63.7 GC%=65.0 Tm(prod)=52.8
   4 ACCGCTGGCCGAGCATCTGC   23 Tm=66.9 GC%=70.0 Tm(prod)=54.9
   5 CCGCTGGCCGAGCATCTGCT   24 Tm=66.7 GC%=70.0 Tm(prod)=54.9
   6 CGCTGGCCGAGCATCTGCTC   25 Tm=65.5 GC%=70.0 Tm(prod)=54.9

   8 CTGGCCGAGCATCTGCTCGA   27 Tm=63.7 GC%=65.0 Tm(prod)=52.8
etc.
</pre>


<p>
If the qualifier '-thermo' is givedn then the DeltaG, DeltaH and DeltaS
of the sequence in the window is also output. 

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>


The EMBOSS data files "Edna.melt" and "Erna.melt" are used to read in the
entropy/enthalpy/energy data for DNA and RNA respectively. 

<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
