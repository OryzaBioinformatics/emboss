Trim poly-A tails off EST sequences

<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
        Algorithms
  -->

EST and mRNA sequences often have poly-A tails at the end of them.  This
utility removes those poly-A tails. 

<p>

EST sequences are often the reverse complement of the corresponding
mRNA's forward sense and have poly-T tails at their 5' end.  By default,
this program also detects and removes these and writes out the reverse
complement of the sequence. 

<p>

<b>trimest</b> is not infallible.  There are often repeats of 'A' (or
'T') in a sequence that just happen by chance to occur at the 3' (or 5')
end of the EST sequence.  <b>trimest</b> has no way of determining if the
A's it finds are part of a real poly-A tail or are a part of the
transcribed genomic sequence.  It removes any apparent poly-A tails that
match its criteria for a poly-A tail. 

<p>

<b>trimest</b> looks for a repeat of at least '-minlength' A's at the 3'
end (and, by default, '-minlength' T's at the 5' end).  If there are an
apparent 5' poly-T tail and a poly-A tail, then it removes whichever is
the longer of the two. 

<p>

By default, it will allow '-mismatches' non-A (or non-T) bases in the
tail.  If a mismatch is found, then there has to be at least
'-minlength' A's (or T's) past the mismatch (working from the end) for
the mismatch to be considered part of the tail.  If '-mismatches' is
greater than 1 then that number of contiguous non-A (or non-T) bases
will be allowed as part of the tail. 

<p>

If a 5' poly-T tail is found, then the sequence will be optionally
reverse-complemented when it is written out. 

<p>

If a poly-A tail is reomved then '[poly-A tail removed]' is appended to
the description of the sequence.  If poly-T is removed, then '[poly-T
tail removed]' is appended and if the sequence is reversed, '[reverse
complement]' is appended.

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
  [-outseq]            seqoutall  Output sequence(s) USA

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -minlength          integer    This is the minimum length that a poly-A (or
                                  poly-T) tail must have before it is
                                  removed. If there are mismatches in the tail
                                  than there must be at least this length of
                                  poly-A tail before the mismatch for the
                                  mismatch to be considered part of the tail.
   -mismatches         integer    If there are this number or fewer contiguous
                                  non-A bases in a poly-A tail then, if there
                                  are '-minlength' 'A' bases before them,
                                  they will be considered part of the tail and
                                  removed .
                                  For example the terminal 4 A's of GCAGAAAA
                                  would be removed with the default values of
                                  -minlength=4 and -mismatches=1 (There are
                                  not at least 4 A's before the last 'G' and
                                  so only the A's after it are considered to
                                  be part of the tail). The terminal 9 bases
                                  of GCAAAAGAAAA would be removed; There are
                                  at least -minlength A's preceeding the last
                                  'G', so it is part of the tail.
   -[no]reverse        boolean    When a poly-T region at the 5' end of the
                                  sequence is found and removed, it is likely
                                  that the sequence is in the reverse sense.
                                  This option will change the sequence to the
                                  forward sense when it is written out. If
                                  this option is not set, then the sense will
                                  not be changed.
   -tolower            toggle     The poly-A region can be 'masked' by
                                  converting the sequence characters to
                                  lower-case. Some non-EMBOSS programs e.g.
                                  fasta can interpret this as a masked region.
                                  The sequence is unchanged apart from the
                                  case change. You might like to ensure that
                                  the whole sequence is in upper-case before
                                  masking the specified regions to lower-case
                                  by using the '-supper' sequence qualifier.

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:

                                  These will be removed if they are longer
                                  than any 3' poly-A tails. If this is false,
                                  then the 5' end is ignored.

The output is a set of sequences with the poly-A (or poly-T) tails
removed.  If a sequence had a 5' poly-T tail then the resulting sequence
is reverse-complemented by default.  The description line has a comment
appended about the changes made to the sequence.
