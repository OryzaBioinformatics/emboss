    Description

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
        Algorithms

This is part of Jon Ison's protein structure analysis package.

<p>

This package is still being developed.

<p>

Please ignore this program until further details can be documented.

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc.

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 

        If you wish to include the standard description of the avalable
	report formats, use:
<p>

The output is a standard EMBOSS report file. 

<p>

The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
command-line qualifier <b>-rformat xxx</b>, where 'xxx' is replaced by
the name of the required format.  The available format names are: embl,
genbank, gff, pir, swiss, trace, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq, excel,
feattable, motif, regions, seqtable, simple, srs, table, tagseq

<p>

for further information on report formats.

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.

	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
