    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
        Algorithms
  -->

<b>sigscan</b> scans a signature such as that generated by the EMBOSS
application <b>siggen</b> against a protein sequence database and generates
files of scored hits and corresponding alignments.  

<!-- NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
Optionally, <b>sigscan</b> can use a file of residue pair
substitution frequencies as generated by the EMBOSS application
<b>pairsub</b> during a signature:sequence match.  
-->

An (optionally grouped) scop families file can be provided in which case
a classification of hits is provided in the signature hits output file. 
See documentation for the EMBOSS application <b>psiblasts</b> for an
explanation of the scop families file and groups for information on how
to group it. 






<h3>Signatures</h3>
        
      
Signatures extend the comcept of the motif as a tool for characterizing
protein families.  They consist of a set of N key residue postitions
(A1, A2 ...An) preceeded by gaps (G) thus G1A1G2A2...GnAn.  Both a
residue and a gap can be variable.  A signature is matched to a protein
sequence and scored using a dynamic programming algorithm which permits
variability in gap distance and residue type.  Generating a signature
involves identifying residues associated with points of contact in
interactions between secondary structure alements.  A raw signature
consists of a set of positions with potential key structural roles
sampled from a sequence alignment constructed with reference to this
contact data.  Raw signatures are refined by samplinfg different
gap-residue pairs until the specificity of a signature for the family
cannot be further improved.

    Usage

                                  are penalized. Usually you will expect a few

                                  the gap extension penalty should be lower

Excerpts from an alignment file are shown (Figure 2). The records used

<p>

(1) The DE, CL, FO, SF, FA, XX and // records have the same meaning as 
in the hits file (above).

(2) Other lines contain either a fragment of protein sequence preceeded
by an accession number, or a fragment of an alignment of a signature
to the protein sequence (signature positions are marked with a '*').
The two numbers on either side of the sequence are begin and end residue
numbers for that line.

Definition of classes of hit 

<p>

The primary classification is an objective definition of the hit and has 
one of the following values:

<p>

TRAIN - the sequence was included in the original alignment from which the 
signature was generated.

<p>

PSIBLAST - A protein which was detected by psiblast  (see psiblasts.c) to 
be a homologue to at least one of the proteins in the family from which 
the signature was derived. Such proteins are identified by the 'PSIBLAST' 
record in the scop families file.

<p>

OTHER - A true member of the family but not a homologue as detected by 
psi-blast. Such proteins may have been found from the literature and 
manually added to the scop families file or may have been detected by the 
EMBOSS program swissparse (see swissparse.c). They are identified in the 

<p>

SCOP families file by the 'OTHER' record.

<p>

CROSS - A protein which is homologous to a protein of the same fold,
but differnt family, of the proteins from which the signature was
derived.

<p>

FALSE - A homologue to a protein with a different fold to the family
of the signature.

<p>

UNKNOWN - The protein is not known to be CROSS, FALSE or a true hit 
(TRAIN, PSIBLAST or OTHER).

<p>

The secondary classification is provided for convenience and a value as 
follows:

<p>

Hits of TRAIN, PSIBLAST and OTHER classification are all listed as TRUE.

<p>

Hits of CROSS, FALSE or UNKNOWN objective classification are listed as CROSS,
FALSE or UNKNOWN respectively.

<p>

The subjective column allows for hand-annotation of the hits files so that 
proteins of UNKNOWN objective classification can re-classified by a human 
expert as TRUE, FALSE, CROSS or otherwise left as UNKNOWN for the purpose of 
generating signature performance plots with the EMBOSS application sigplot.

    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall

To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

The directories are searched in the following order:

    Notes
</H2>

<!-- 
        Restrictions.
        Interesting behaviour.
        Useful things you can do with this program.
   -->

Important - <b>sigscan</b> presumes that SCOP family names are unique. If 
this were not the case, changes to ajXyzClassifyHits would have to
be made.

<p>

Important - In the case where a signature file is generated by hand, it
is essential that the gap data given is listed in order of increasing
gap size.
