<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Reads a tree from a tree file, and a data set with continuous
characters data, and produces the independent contrasts for those
characters, for use in any multivariate statistics package. Will also
produce covariances, regressions and correlations between characters
for those contrasts. Can also correct for within-species sampling
variation when individual phenotypes are available within a
population.


<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

This program implements the contrasts calculation described in my 1985
paper on the comparative method (Felsenstein, 1985d). It reads in a
data set of the standard quantitative characters sort, and also a tree
from the treefile. It then forms the contrasts between species that,
according to that tree, are statistically independent. This is done
for each character. The contrasts are all standardized by branch
lengths (actually, square roots of branch lengths).

<p>
The method is explained in the 1985 paper. It assumes a Brownian
motion model. This model was introduced by Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza
(1964; Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards, 1967) as an approximation to the
evolution of gene frequencies. I have discussed (Felsenstein, 1973b,
1981c, 1985d, 1988b) the difficulties inherent in using it as a model
for the evolution of quantitative characters. Chief among these is
that the characters do not necessarily evolve independently or at
equal rates. This program allows one to evaluate this, if there is
independent information on the phylogeny. You can compute the variance
of the contrasts for each character, as a measure of the variance
accumulating per unit branch length. You can also test covariances of
characters.


<p>
The statistics that are printed out include the covariances between
all pairs of characters, the regressions of each character on each
other (column j is regressed on row i), and the correlations between
all pairs of characters. In assessing degress of freedom it is
important to realize that each contrast was taken to have expectation
zero, which is known because each contrast could as easily have been
computed xi-xj instead of xj-xi. Thus there is no loss of a degree of
freedom for estimation of a mean. The degrees of freedom is thus the
same as the number of contrasts, namely one less than the number of
species (tips). If you feed these contrasts into a multivariate
statistics program make sure that it knows that each variable has
expectation exactly zero.


<h3>Within-species variation</h3>

With the W option selected, CONTRAST analyzes data sets with variation
within species, using a model like that proposed by Michael Lynch
(1990). The method is described in vague terms in my book
(Felsenstein, 2004, pp. 441). If you select the W option for
within-species variation, the data set should have this structure (on
the left are the data, on the right my comments:

<p>
<pre>
   10    5                           number of species, number of characters
Alpha        2                       name of 1st species, # of individuals
 2.01 5.3 1.5  -3.41 0.3             data for individual #1
 1.98 4.3 2.1  -2.98 0.45            data for individual #2
Gammarus     3                       name of 2nd species, # of individuals
 6.57 3.1 2.0  -1.89 0.6             data for individual #1
 7.62 3.4 1.9  -2.01 0.7             data for individual #2
 6.02 3.0 1.9  -2.03 0.6             data for individual #3
...                                  (and so on)


</pre>

<p>
The covariances, correlations, and regressions for the "additive"
(between-species evolutionary variation) and "environmental"
(within-species phenotypic variation) are printed out (the maximum
likelihood estimates of each). The program also estimates the
within-species phenotypic variation in the case where the
between-species evolutionary covariances are forced to be zero. The
log-likelihoods of these two cases are compared and a likelihood ratio
test (LRT) is carried out. The program prints the result of this test
as a chi-square variate, and gives the number of degrees of freedom of
the LRT. You have to look up the chi-square variable on a table of the
chi-square distribution. The A option is available (if the W option is
invoked) to allow you to turn off the doing of this test if you want
to.

<p>
The log-likelihood of the data under the models with and without
between-species For the moment the program cannot handle the case
where within-species variation is to be taken into account but where
only species means are available. (It can handle cases where some
species have only one member in their sample).

<p>
We hope to fix this soon. We are also on our way to incorporating
full-sib, half-sib, or clonal groups within species, so as to do one
analysis for within-species genetic and between-species phylogenetic
variation.

<p>
The data set used as an example below is the example from a paper by
Michael Lynch (1990), his characters having been log-transformed. In
the case where there is only one specimen per species, Lynch's model
is identical to our model of within-species variation (for multiple
individuals per species it is not a subcase of his model).

<b>fcontrast</b> reads continuous character data.


<h3>Continuous character data</h3>
The programs in this group use gene frequencies and quantitative
character values. One (CONTML) constructs maximum likelihood estimates
of the phylogeny, another (GENDIST) computes genetic distances for use
in the distance matrix programs, and the third (CONTRAST) examines
correlation of traits as they evolve along a given phylogeny.

<p>
When the gene frequencies data are used in CONTML or GENDIST, this
involves the following assumptions:

<ol>

<li>
Different lineages evolve independently. 

<li>
After two lineages split, their characters change independently. 

<li>
Each gene frequency changes by genetic drift, with or without mutation
(this varies from method to method).

<li>
Different loci or characters drift independently. 

</ol>

<p>
How these assumptions affect the methods will be seen in my papers on
inference of phylogenies from gene frequency and continuous character
data (Felsenstein, 1973b, 1981c, 1985c).


<p>
The input formats are fairly similar to the discrete-character
programs, but with one difference. When CONTML is used in the
gene-frequency mode (its usual, default mode), or when GENDIST is
used, the first line contains the number of species (or populations)
and the number of loci and the options information. There then follows
a line which gives the numbers of alleles at each locus, in
order. This must be the full number of alleles, not the number of
alleles which will be input: i. e. for a two-allele locus the number
should be 2, not 1. There then follow the species (population) data,
each species beginning on a new line. The first 10 characters are
taken as the name, and thereafter the values of the individual
characters are read free-format, preceded and separated by
blanks. They can go to a new line if desired, though of course not in
the middle of a number. Missing data is not allowed - an important
limitation. In the default configuration, for each locus, the numbers
should be the frequencies of all but one allele. The menu option A
(All) signals that the frequencies of all alleles are provided in the
input data -- the program will then automatically ignore the last of
them. So without the A option, for a three-allele locus there should
be two numbers, the frequencies of two of the alleles (and of course
it must always be the same two!). Here is a typical data set without
the A option:

<p>
<pre>
     5    3
2 3 2
Alpha      0.90 0.80 0.10 0.56
Beta       0.72 0.54 0.30 0.20
Gamma      0.38 0.10 0.05  0.98
Delta      0.42 0.40 0.43 0.97
Epsilon    0.10 0.30 0.70 0.62
</pre>
 


<p>
whereas here is what it would have to look like if the A option were invoked: 

<p>
<pre>
     5    3
2 3 2
Alpha      0.90 0.10 0.80 0.10 0.10 0.56 0.44
Beta       0.72 0.28 0.54 0.30 0.16 0.20 0.80
Gamma      0.38 0.62 0.10 0.05 0.85  0.98 0.02
Delta      0.42 0.58 0.40 0.43 0.17 0.97 0.03
Epsilon    0.10 0.90 0.30 0.70 0.00 0.62 0.38

</pre> 


<p>
The first line has the number of species (or populations) and the
number of loci. The second line has the number of alleles for each of
the 3 loci. The species lines have names (filled out to 10 characters
with blanks) followed by the gene frequencies of the 2 alleles for the
first locus, the 3 alleles for the second locus, and the 2 alleles for
the third locus. You can start a new line after any of these allele
frequencies, and continue to give the frequencies on that line
(without repeating the species name).

<p>
If all alleles of a locus are given, it is important to have them add
up to 1. Roundoff of the frequencies may cause the program to conclude
that the numbers do not sum to 1, and stop with an error message.

<p>
While many compilers may be more tolerant, it is probably wise to make
sure that each number, including the first, is preceded by a blank,
and that there are digits both preceding and following any decimal
points.

<p>
CONTML and CONTRAST also treat quantitative characters (the
continuous-characters mode in CONTML, which is option C). It is
assumed that each character is evolving according to a Brownian motion
model, at the same rate, and independently. In reality it is almost
always impossible to guarantee this. The issue is discussed at length
in my review article in Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics
(Felsenstein, 1988a), where I point out the difficulty of transforming
the characters so that they are not only genetically independent but
have independent selection acting on them. If you are going to use
CONTML to model evolution of continuous characters, then you should at
least make some attempt to remove genetic correlations between the
characters (usually all one can do is remove phenotypic correlations
by transforming the characters so that there is no within-population
covariance and so that the within-population variances of the
characters are equal -- this is equivalent to using Canonical
Variates). However, this will only guarantee that one has removed
phenotypic covariances between characters. Genetic covariances could
only be removed by knowing the coheritabilities of the characters,
which would require genetic experiments, and selective covariances
(covariances due to covariation of selection pressures) would require
knowledge of the sources and extent of selection pressure in all
variables.

<p>
CONTRAST is a program designed to infer, for a given phylogeny that is
provided to the program, the covariation between characters in a data
set. Thus we have a program in this set that allow us to take
information about the covariation and rates of evolution of characters
and make an estimate of the phylogeny (CONTML), and a program that
takes an estimate of the phylogeny and infers the variances and
covariances of the character changes. But we have no program that
infers both the phylogenies and the character covariation from the
same data set.

<p>
In the quantitative characters mode, a typical small data set would be: 

<p>
<pre>
     5   6
Alpha      0.345 0.467 1.213  2.2  -1.2 1.0
Beta       0.457 0.444 1.1    1.987 -0.2 2.678
Gamma      0.6 0.12 0.97 2.3  -0.11 1.54
Delta      0.68  0.203 0.888 2.0  1.67
Epsilon    0.297  0.22 0.90 1.9 1.74

</pre>


<p>
Note that in the latter case, there is no line giving the numbers of
alleles at each locus. In this latter case no square-root
transformation of the coordinates is done: each is assumed to give
directly the position on the Brownian motion scale.

<p>
For further discussion of options and modifiable constants in CONTML,
GENDIST, and CONTRAST see the documentation files for those programs.
