<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
        Algorithms
  -->

<b>abiview</b> reads in an ABI sequence trace file and graphically
displays the results. 

<p>

The data for each nucleotide is plotted and the assigned nucleotide (G,
A, T, C or N) in the ABI file is overlayed on the graphs. 

<p>

It also writes out the sequence to an output sequence file. 












<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.
 -->


Here is a sample session with abiview:

<pre>

% abiview
Name of the ABI trace file: ba16d2.s1
Output sequence [outfile.fasta]: 
Graph type [x11]:

    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->


This reads in a standard ABI trace file.












<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc.

It outputs a file holding a normal nucleotide sequence.
<p>

It outputs a graphical image of the traces.
<br>
<a href = "abiview0.gif">The graphical output from the above example is here.</A>

<p>

The horizontal scale of the output image labelled 'Residue Position' is
only a very approximate indication of the spacing of residues in the
image.  The real residue spacing is variable, as it relies on the speed
with which the oligo-nucleotides are eluted in the ABI sequencer.  Do
not be surprised to see the nucleotide signals spaced at a much greater
distance than the horizontal scale might suggest. 














<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
