    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
        Algorithms
  -->

This small utility writes out the current version of the EMBOSS package.

<p>

It is expected that this may have a use in scripts which automatically
write descriptions of the state of the EMBOSS package that is set up
locally. 

<p>

It will also be a useful way for people to ascertain what version is
being run if they are giving user-support to people in another site. 









<H2>
    Usage

	Example usage, as run from the command-line.

    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc.

    Output file format

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc.

<p>

<b>embossversion</b> writes just the version number followed by a
newline character to end the line. 

<p>

The output is written to the screen by default, but can be written to a
named file by using the '-outfile' option. 

<p>

The version number is in three parts, separated by '.'s.
<br>
The first number is the major version number - this only changes when substantial changes have been made to the look-and-feel of EMBOSS.
<br>
The second number is the minor version number - this is incremented whenever a version is released.
<br>
The third number is usually '0' but if a minor bug fix has been released that does not warrant a minor version number, this will be incremented.










<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
