    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
        Algorithms
  -->

The Restriction Enzyme database (REBASE) is a collection of information
about restriction enzymes and related proteins.  It contains published
and unpublished references, recognition and cleavage sites,
isoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation sensitivity, crystal
and sequence data.  DNA methyltransferases, homing endonucleases,
nicking enzymes, specificity subunits and control proteins are also
included.  Most recently, putative DNA methyltransferases and
restriction enzymes, as predicted from analysis of genomic sequences,
are also listed. 

<p>

The home page of REBASE is: http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html 

<p>

<b>restover</b> takes a specified sequence and a short sequence of a
cut-site overhang and searches the REBASE database for matching enzymes
that create the desired overhang sequence when they cut the
input sequence. 












<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

The output from <b>restover</b> is a simple text one.  The base number,
restriction enzyme name, recognition site and cut positions are shown. 
Note that cuts are always to the right of the residue shown and that 5'
cuts are referred to by their associated 3' number sequence.  The
program reports enzymes that cut at two or four sites.














<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
<p>

   -->

The data files are stored in the REBASE directory of the standard EMBOSS
data directory.  The names are:

<p>
<ul>
<li>      embossre.enz Cleavage information 
<li>      embossre.ref Reference/methylation information 
<li>      embossre.sup Supplier information 
</ul>
<p>
The column information is described at the top of the data files

    Notes

<!-- 
        Restrictions.
        Interesting behaviour.
        Useful things you can do with this program.
   -->

The data files must have been created before running this program.  This
is done by running the <b>rebaseextract</b> program with the "withrefm" file
from an REBASE release.  You may have to ask your system manager to do
this.
