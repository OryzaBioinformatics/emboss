Test file for ACD parsing


<H2>
    Description
</H2>

If you are not interested in developing EMBOSS programs yourself, then
you should stop reading now. 

<br>

Read no further.

<p>

<b>ajtest</b> is of no use to you.

<p>

<b>ajtest</b> is simply the name given to a generic test program that is
used to evaluate the behaviour of various EMBOSS functions during the
writing of other programs.  The contents of this program will change
depending on whatever programs were last being developed when this
EMBOSS release was made public. 

<p>

<b>ajtest</b> serves no purpose that is useful for the general user
community.  It is only useful as a general-purpose program to serve as a
test-bed for developers. 

<p>

It is here simply as a useful generic application for people creating
new library functions that they wish to call in the context of a real
EMBOSS program. 

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>


Here is a sample session with ajtest.

<pre>

% ajtest

(You are less than impressed, I can tell.)
