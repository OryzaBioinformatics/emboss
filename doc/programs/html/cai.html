    Description

	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
        Algorithms
  -->

<b>cai</b> calculates the <b>Codon Adaptation Index</b>.  This is a
simple, effective measure of synonymous codon usage bias. 

<p>

The index uses a reference set of highly expressed genes from a species
to assess the relative merits of each codon, and a score for a gene is
calculated from the frequency of use of all codons in that gene.  The
index assesses the extent to which selection has been effective in
moulding the pattern of codon usage.  In that respect it is useful for
predicting the level of expression of a gene, for assessing the
adaptation of viral genes to their hosts, and for making comparisons of
codon usage in different organisms.  The index may also give an
approximate indication of the likely success of heterologous gene
expression. 






<H2>
    Usage

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

    Input file format

        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc.

<b>cai</b> writes the Codon Adaptation Index to the output file.

    Data files

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are

   -->

<b>cai</b> reads a reference codon usage table prepared from a set of
genes which are known to be highly expressed.

<p>

The default codon usage table 'Eyeastcai.cut' was prepared from a set of
S.  pombe genes by Peter Rice. 

<p>

You should prepare your own codon usage table for your organism of interest.

<p>

<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
