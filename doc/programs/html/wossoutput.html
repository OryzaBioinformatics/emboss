    Function
</H2>
Finds programs by EDAM output data
<!--
DON'T WRITE ANYTHING HERE.
IT IS DONE FOR YOU.
-->




<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<b>wossoutput</b> searches the annotation of application outputs in ACD files, using terms from the EDAM ontology. There are various options for controlling how the search is performed and what is given in the output file.  Optionally, the output will be wrapped in HTML tags ready for inclusion in a Web page.</p>




<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

The first search is of the EDAM ontology data namespace, using the
term names and their synonynms. All child terms are automatically
included in the set of matches inless the <tt>-nosubclasses</tt>
qualifier is used.

<p>
The <tt>-sensitive</tt> qualifier also searches the definition strings.

<p>
The set of EDAM terms are then compared to relations in the output
datatypes in the ACD file, where input and output definitions require
EDAM data references.

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

Finds programs by EDAM output data
Version: EMBOSS:6.4.0.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-identifier]        string     Identifier(s) to search for in ontology (Any
                                  string)

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -explode            boolean    [N] The groups that EMBOSS applications
                                  belong to have two forms, exploded and not
                                  exploded. The exploded group names are more
                                  numerous and often vaguely phrased than the
                                  non-exploded ones. The exploded names are
                                  formed from definitions of the group names
                                  that start like NAME1:NAME2 and which are
                                  then expanded into many combinations of the
                                  names as: 'NAME1', 'NAME2', 'NAME1 NAME2',
                                  NAME2 NAME1'. The non-expanded names are
                                  simply like: 'NAME1 NAME2'.
   -showkeywords       boolean    [N] Show keywords with program documentation
   -outfile            outfile    [stdout] Tool metadata output file
   -html               toggle     [N] If you are sending the output to a file,
                                  this will format it for displaying as a
                                  table in a WWW document.
   -groups             boolean    [N] If you use this option, then only the
                                  group names will be output to the file
   -alphabetic         boolean    [N] If you use this option, then you will
                                  get a single list of the program names and
                                  descriptions instead of the programs being
                                  listed in their functional groups.

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -sensitive          boolean    [N] By default, the query keywords are
                                  matched against the EDAM term names (and
                                  synonyms) only. This option also matches the
                                  keywords against the EDAM term definitions
                                  and will therefore (typically) report more
                                  matches.
   -[no]subclasses     boolean    [Y] Extend the query matches to include all
                                  terms which are specialisations (EDAM
                                  sub-classes) of the matched type.
   -obsolete           boolean    [N] The default behaviour is to not use or
                                  return obsolete terms. This option if set
                                  will include all terms.
   -[no]emboss         boolean    [Y] If you use this option then EMBOSS
                                  program documentation will be searched. If
                                  this option is set to be false, then only
                                  the EMBASSY programs will be searched (if
                                  the -embassy option is true). EMBASSY
                                  programs are not strictly part of EMBOSS,
                                  but use the same code libraries and share
                                  the same look and feel, but are generally
                                  developed by people who wish the programs to
                                  be outside of the GNU Public Licence scheme
   -[no]embassy        boolean    [Y] If you use this option then EMBASSY
                                  program documentation will be searched. If
                                  this option is set to be false, then only
                                  the EMBOSS programs will be searched (if the
                                  -emboss option is true). EMBASSY programs
                                  are not strictly part of EMBOSS, but use the
                                  same code libraries and share the same look
                                  and feel, but are generally developed by
                                  people who wish the programs to be outside
                                  of the GNU Public Licence scheme
   -showembassy        string     If you use this option then this EMBASSY
                                  package program documentation will be
                                  searched. EMBASSY programs are not strictly
                                  part of EMBOSS, but use the same code
                                  libraries and share the same look and feel,
                                  but are generally developed by people who
                                  wish the programs to be outside of the GNU
                                  Public Licence scheme (Any string)
   -colon              boolean    [N] The groups that EMBOSS applications
                                  belong to up to two levels, for example the
                                  primary group 'ALIGNMENT' has several
                                  sub-groups, or second-level groups, e.g.:
                                  CONSENSUS, DIFFERENCES, DOT PLOTS, GLOBAL,
                                  LOCAL, MULTIPLE. To aid programs that parse
                                  the output of wossname that require the
                                  names of these subgroups, a colon ':' will
                                  be placed between the first and second level
                                  of the group name if this option is true.
                                  Note: This does not apply if the group names
                                  have been exploded with the 'explode'
                                  option.
   -gui                boolean    [N] This option is intended to help those
                                  who are designing Graphical User Interfaces
                                  to the EMBOSS applications. Some EMBOSS
                                  programs are inappropriate for running in a
                                  GUI, these include other menu programs and
                                  interactive editors. This option allows you
                                  to only report those programs that can be
                                  run from a GUI
