Distances between two sets of trees

<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Computes the Branch Score distance between trees, which allows for
differences in tree topology and which also makes use of branch
lengths. Also computes the Robinson-Foulds symmetric difference
distance between trees, which allows for differences in tree topology
but does not use branch lengths.

<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

This program computes distances between trees. Two distances are
computed, the Branch Score Distance of Kuhner and Felsenstein (1994),
and the more widely known Symmetric Difference of Robinson and Foulds
(1981). The Branch Score Distance uses branch lengths, and can only be
calculated when the trees have lengths on all branches. The Symmetric
Difference does not use branch length information, only the tree
topologies. It must also be borne in mind that neither distance has
any immediate statistical interpretation -- we cannot say whether a
larger distance is significantly larger than a smaller one.

<p>
These distances are computed by considering all possible branches that
could exist on the the two trees. Each branch divides the set of
species into two groups -- the ones connected to one end of the branch
and the ones connected to the other. This makes a partition of the
full set of species. (in Newick notation)
<p>
<pre>
  ((A,C),(D,(B,E))) 
</pre>
<p>
has two internal branches. One induces the partition {A, C | B, D, E}
and the other induces the partition {A, C, D | B, E}. A different tree
with the same set of species,
<p>
<pre>
  (((A,D),C),(B,E)) 
</pre>
<p>
has internal branches that correspond to the two partitions {A, C, D |
B, E} and {A, D | B, C, E}. Note that the other branches, all of which
are external branches, induce partitions that separate one species
from all the others. Thus there are 5 partitions like this: {C | A, B,
D, E} on each of these trees. These are always present on all trees,
provided that each tree has each species at the end of its own branch.

<p>
In the case of the Branch Score distance, each partition that does
exist on a tree also has a branch length associated with it. Thus if
the tree is

<p>
<pre>
  (((A:0.1,D:0.25):0.05,C:0.01):0.2,(B:0.3,E:0.8):0.2) 

</pre>
<p>
The list of partitions and their branch lengths is:

<p>
<pre>
{A  |  B, C, D, E}     0.1 
{D  |  A, B, C, E}     0.25 
{A, D  |  B, C, E}     0.05 
{C  |  A, B, D, E}     0.01 
{A, D, C  |  B, E}     0.4 
{B  |  A, C, D, E}     0.3 
{E  |  A, B, C, D}     0.8 
</pre>
<p>
Note that the tree is being treated as unrooted here, so that the
branch lengths on either side of the rootmost node are summed up to
get a branch length of 0.4.

<p>
The Branch Score Distance imagines us as having made a list of all
possible partitions, the ones shown above and also all 7 other
possible partitions, which correspond to branches that are not found
in this tree. These are assigned branch lengths of 0. For two trees,
we imagine constructing these lists, and then summing the squared
differences between the branch lengths. Thus if both trees have
branches {A, D | B, C, E}, the sum contains the square of the
difference between the branch lengths. If one tree has the branch and
the other doesn't, it contains the square of the difference between
the branch length and zero (in other words, the square of that branch
length). If both trees do not have a particular branch, nothing is
added to the sum because the difference is then between 0 and 0.

<p>
The Branch Score Distance takes this sum of squared differences and
computes its square root. Note that it has some desirable
properties. When small branches differ in tree topology, it is not
very big. When branches are both present but differ in length, it is
affected.

<p>
The Symmetric Difference is simply a count of how many partitions
there are, among the two trees, that are on one tree and not on the
other. In the example above there are two partitions, {A, C | B, D, E}
and {A, D | B, C, E}, each of which is present on only one of the two
trees. The Symmetric Difference between the two trees is therefore
2. When the two trees are fully resolved bifurcating trees, their
symmetric distance must be an even number; it can range from 0 to
twice the number of internal branches, which for n species is 4n-6.

<p>
Note the relationship between the two distances. If all trees have all
their branches have length 1.0, the Branch Score Distance is the
square of the Symmetric Difference, as each branch that is present in
one but not in the other results in 1.0 being added to the sum of
squared differences.

<p>
We have assumed that nothing is lost if the trees are treated as
unrooted trees. It is easy to define a counterpart to the Branch Score
Distance and one to the Symmetric Difference for these rooted
trees. Each branch then defines a set of species, namely the clade
defined by that branch. Thus if the first of the two trees above were
considered as a rooted tree it would define the three clades {A, C},
{B, D, E}, and {B, E}. The Branch Score Distance is computed from the
branch lengths for all possible sets of species, with 0 put for each
set that does not occur on that tree. The table above will be nearly
the same, but with two entries instead of one for the sets on either
side of the root, {A C D} and {B E}. The Symmetric Difference between
two rooted trees is simply the count of the number of clades that are
defined by one but not by the other. For the second tree the clades
would be {A, D}, {B, C, E}, and {B, E}. The Symmetric Difference
between thee two rooted trees would then be 4.

<p>
Although the examples we have discussed have involved fully
bifurcating trees, the input trees can have multifurcations. This does
not cause any complication for the Branch Score Distance. For the
Symmetric Difference, it can lead to distances that are odd numbers.

<p>
However, note one strong restriction. The trees should all have the
same list of species. If you use one set of species in the first two
trees, and another in the second two, and choose distances for
adjacent pairs, the distances will be incorrect and will depend on the
order of these pairs in the input tree file, in odd ways.

<b>ftreedistpair</b> reads two input tree files. The tree files may
either have the number of trees on their first line, or not. If the
number of trees is given, it is actually ignored and all trees in the
tree file are considered, even if there are more trees than indicated
by the number. There is no maximum number of trees that can be
processed but, if you feed in too many, there may be an error message
about running out of memory. The problem is particularly acute if you
choose the option to examine all possible pairs of trees one from each
of two input tree files. Thus if there are 1,000 trees in the input
tree file, keep in mind that all possible pairs means 1,000,000 pairs
to be examined!

<p>
The Full matrix is only available for analyses P and L (not for A or
C).

<p>
Option V (Verbose) writes one distance per line. The Verbose output is
the default. Here it is for the example data set given below:


<p>
<pre>
Tree distance program, version 3.6

Symmetric differences between adjacent pairs of trees:

Trees 1 and 2:    4
Trees 3 and 4:    10
Trees 5 and 6:    4
Trees 7 and 8:    4
Trees 9 and 10:    4
Trees 11 and 12:    10
</pre>
 


<p>
Option S (Sparse or terse) is similar except that all that is given on
each line are the numbers of the two trees and the distance, separated
by blanks. This may be a convenient format if you want to write a
program to read these numbers in, and you want to spare yourself the
effort of having the program wade through the words on each line in
the Verbose output. The first four lines of the Sparse output are
titles that your program would want to skip past. Here is the Sparse
output for the example trees.

<p>
<pre>
1 2 4
3 4 10
5 6 4
7 8 4
9 10 4
