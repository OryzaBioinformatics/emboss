<b>contacts</b> parses an embl-like clean coordinate files generated by
the <b>coorde</b> application (not currently in emboss, email Jon Ison
jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk) or the <b>domainer</b> application and writes, for
each file in a given directory, files of residue-residue contact data in
embl-like format.  Each of these files contains residue contact data for
each chain of every model in the coordinate file (or the single scop
domain in the case where domainer output is read). 

<p>

Contact between two residues is defined as when the van der Waals surface of 
any atom of the first residue comes within the threshold contact distance of 
the van der Waals surface of any atom of the second residue. The threshold 
contact distance is a user-defined distance with a default value of 1 
Angstrom.

<p>

The following van der Waals radii are used: 

<p>
<pre>
C:1.8 Angstrom 
O:1.4 Angstrom 
N:1.7 Angstrom 
S:2.0 Angstrom
H:1.0 Angstrom (default for other or unknown atom types)
</pre>

    Usage

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

    Output file format

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 
   -->

The embl-like format used for the contact files uses the following
records:

<p>

<ol>
<li>ID - either the 4-character PDB identifier code (where clean protein 
coordinate files are used as input) or the 7-character domain identifier 
code taken from scop (where domain coordinate files were used as input; see 
documentation for the EMBOSS application scope for further info.)

<li>DE - bibliographic information.  The text "Residue-residue contact 
data" is always given.

<li>EX - experimental information. The value of the threshold contact 
distance is given as a floating point number after 'THRESH'. The number of 
models and number of polypeptide chains are given after 'NMOD' and 'NCHA' 
respectively. domain coordinate files a 1 is always given. Following the EX 
record, the file will have a section containing a CN, IN and SM records 
(see below) for each chain. The sections for each chain of a model are given 
after the MO record.

<li>MO - model number. The number given in brackets after this record 
indicates the start of a section of model-specific data. 

<li>CN - chain number.  The number given in brackets after this record 
indicates the start of a section of chain-specific data.

<li>IN - chain specific data. The character given after ID is the PDB chain 
identifier taken from the input file, (a '.` given in cases where a chain 
identifier was not specified in the original pdb file or, for domain 
coordinate files, the domain is comprised of more than one domain).  The 
number of amino acid residues comprising the chain (or the chains from 
which a domain is comprised) is given after NR. The number of residue-residue
contacts is given after NSMCON. 

<li>SM - Line of residue contact data. Pairs of amino acid identifiers and 
residue numbers are delimited by a ';'. Residue numbers are taken from the 
clean coordinate file and give a correct index into the sequence (i.e. they
are not necessarily the same as the original pdb file).

<li>XX - used for spacing.

<li>// - given on the last line of the file only.
</ol>

<p>

Note - SM records are used for contacts between either either side-chain 
or main-chain atoms as defined above.  In a future implementation, SS will
be used for side-chain only contacts, MM will be used for main-chain only 
contacts, and there will probably be several other forms of contact too.

<p>

Example contacts output file:

<p>
<hr>
<pre>
ID   D1HBBB_

XX
EX   THRESH 10.0; NMOD 1; NCHA 1;

<hr>
<p>


<b>contacts</b> generates a log file an excerpt of which is shown
below.  If there is a problem in processing a coordinate file,
three lines containing the record '//', the scop domain or pdb
identifier code and an error message respectively are written.  The text
'WARN file open error filename', 'ERROR file read error filename' or
'ERROR file write error filename ' will be reported when an error was
encountered during a file open, read or write respectively.  Various
other error messages may also be given (in case of difficulty email Jon
Ison, jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).

   -->

<b>contacts</b> reads in data on van der Waals radii for atoms in
proteins from the data file <b>Evdw.dat</b> (by default). 

<p>

<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
