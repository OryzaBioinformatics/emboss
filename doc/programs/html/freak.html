Residue/base frequency table or plot


<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.

        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will
        do what he wants. 

        Long description.

        Why it is useful.

        When it should/shouldn't be used.

        Algorithms

        Expanded description.

        eg: Reverse engineers Wheedle's 'talpsgob' program. This does a 
        splurge of the 5' end of the sequence followed by a durm.
        The net effect is a 5' end splurt.
        etc. for as long as is required (several pages is not unreasonable)
  -->

<b>freak</b> takes one or more sequences as input and a set of bases or
residues to search for. It then calculates the frequency of these
bases/residues in a window as it moves along the sequence.  The
frequency is output to a data file or (optionally) plotted.
<P>

The default set of bases is 'cg' which will calculate the frequency of
'G' + 'C' bases within the default moving window of 30 bases. 

<H2>
    Usage

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

window of the bases or residues being searched for.

</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.

        eg:
        data file format:

	blank lines and comment lines are ignored.
        comment lines start with '#'
        There are three columns separated by one or more space or TAB
	characters for X and Y values of durm, followed by energy
        all coefficients are given as floating point values
        An example is:

        # Durm coefficient enery file
        # X     Y       Energy
        0.1     0.2     0.331

<!-- 
        Potentially stupid things the program will let you do.

    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

<!-- 
        Error messages specific to this program.
        eg:

        "Threshold value greater than 1." - means that the threshold has
        been set to be greater than 1 but a burgle exception has
        occurred making this invalid - you should reduce the wobble
        parameter and try again.

None.

<!-- 
        Description of the exit status for various error conditions
