Residue/base frequency table or plot

    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.

        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will
        do what he wants. 

        Long description.

        Why it is useful.

        When it should/shouldn't be used.

        Algorithms

        Expanded description.

        eg: Reverse engineers Wheedle's 'talpsgob' program. This does a 
        splurge of the 5' end of the sequence followed by a durm.
        The net effect is a 5' end splurt.
        etc. for as long as is required (several pages is not unreasonable)

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

    Input file format

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        Except for sequences which can be described by 'sequence USA',
        this should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc.

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.

        eg:
        data file format:

	blank lines and comment lines are ignored.
        comment lines start with '#'
        There are three columns separated by one or more space or TAB
	characters for X and Y values of durm, followed by energy
        all coefficients are given as floating point values
        An example is:

        # Durm coefficient enery file
        # X     Y       Energy
        0.1     0.2     0.331
        0.2     0.4     0.332
        0.3     0.6     0.333
        0.3     0.8     0.334

    Notes
</H2>

<!-- 
        Restrictions.
        Interesting behaviour.
        Useful things you can do with this program.
   -->

    References
</H2>

<!-- 
        Bibliography for methods used.
   -->


<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

<!-- 
        Potentially stupid things the program will let you do.
        eg:
        It doesn't check to see if the sequence is a protein sequence or not.
   -->

<H2>
    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

<!-- 
        Error messages specific to this program.
        eg:

        "Threshold value greater than 1." - means that the threshold has
        been set to be greater than 1 but a burgle exception has
        occurred making this invalid - you should reduce the wobble
        parameter and try again. 

   -->


<H2>
    Exit status
</H2>

<!-- 
        Description of the exit status for various error conditions
        eg:
        "It always exits with status 0"
   -->
