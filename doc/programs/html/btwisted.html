<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.

   <b>btwisted</b> takes a region of a pure DNA sequence and calculates by simple 
   arithmetic the probable overall twist of the sequence and the stacking 
   energy.











<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.
 -->


Here is a sample session with btwisted:

<pre>

% btwisted embl:ab000095 -sbegin 100 -send 120
Calculates the twisting in a B-DNA sequence 
Output file [ab000095.btwisted]:

        This includes example input file formats.

This is the output from the example usage above:
<p>

<pre>
# Output from BTWISTED
# Twisting calculated from 100 to 120 of AB000095
Total twist (degrees): 646.6
Total turns : 1.80
Average bases per turn: 11.69
Total stacking energy : -172.77
Average stacking energy per dinucleotide: -8.64

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
<p>

   -->

The program reads in two data files.
<P>
The first is prompted for by:
<P>
"File containing base pair twist angles"
<P>
<br>
This is the data file 'Eangles.dat' by default.
<P>
This consists of the data:
<P>
<pre>
aa      35.6    0.1
ac      34.4    1.3
ag      27.7    1.5

tg      34.5    0.9
tt      35.6    0.1
</pre>
<p>




The second is prompted for by:
<P>
"File containing base pair stacking energies"
<br>
This is the data file 'Eenergy.dat' by default.
<P>
This consists of the data:
<P>
<pre>
#base pair stacking energy for B-DNA
aa      -5.37
ac      -10.51
ag      -6.78
at      -6.57
ca      -6.57
cc      -8.26
cg      -9.69

ta      -3.82
tc      -9.81
tg      -6.57
tt      -5.37
</pre>
<P>

  No check is made that all dinucleotides have been read for the energy and 
  twist. Attempting to run btwisted with an incomplete data file will result
  a fatal error if the sequence contains a dinucleotide not in the data files.
