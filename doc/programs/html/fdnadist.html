<H2>
    Description
</H2>

Computes four different distances between species from nucleic acid
sequences. The distances can then be used in the distance matrix
programs. The distances are the Jukes-Cantor formula, one based on
Kimura's 2- parameter method, the F84 model used in DNAML, and the
LogDet distance. The distances can also be corrected for
gamma-distributed and gamma-plus-invariant-sites-distributed rates of
change in different sites. Rates of evolution can vary among sites in
a prespecified way, and also according to a Hidden Markov model. The
program can also make a table of percentage similarity among
sequences.




<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>


This program uses nucleotide sequences to compute a distance matrix,
under four different models of nucleotide substitution. It can also
compute a table of similarity between the nucleotide sequences. The
distance for each pair of species estimates the total branch length
between the two species, and can be used in the distance matrix
programs FITCH, KITSCH or NEIGHBOR. This is an alternative to use of
the sequence data itself in the maximum likelihood program DNAML or
the parsimony program DNAPARS.

<p>
The program reads in nucleotide sequences and writes an output file
containing the distance matrix, or else a table of similarity between
sequences. The four models of nucleotide substitution are those of
Jukes and Cantor (1969), Kimura (1980), the F84 model (Kishino and
Hasegawa, 1989; Felsenstein and Churchill, 1996), and the model
underlying the LogDet distance (Barry and Hartigan, 1987; Lake, 1994;
Steel, 1994; Lockhart et. al., 1994). All except the LogDet distance
can be made to allow for for unequal rates of substitution at
different sites, as Jin and Nei (1990) did for the Jukes-Cantor
model. The program correctly takes into account a variety of sequence
ambiguities, although in cases where they exist it can be slow.

<p>
Jukes and Cantor's (1969) model assumes that there is independent
change at all sites, with equal probability. Whether a base changes is
independent of its identity, and when it changes there is an equal
probability of ending up with each of the other three bases. Thus the
transition probability matrix (this is a technical term from
probability theory and has nothing to do with transitions as opposed
to transversions) for a short period of time dt is:


<p>
<pre>
              To:    A        G        C        T
                   ---------------------------------
               A  | 1-3a      a         a       a
       From:   G  |  a       1-3a       a       a
               C  |  a        a        1-3a     a
               T  |  a        a         a      1-3a

</pre>

<p>where a is u dt, the product of the rate of substitution per unit
time (u) and the length dt of the time interval. For longer periods of
time this implies that the probability that two sequences will differ
at a given site is:

<p>
<pre>
      p = 3/4 ( 1 - e- 4/3 u t) 
</pre>

<p>
and hence that if we observe p, we can compute an estimate of the
branch length ut by inverting this to get

<p>
<pre>
     ut = - 3/4 loge ( 1 - 4/3 p ) 
</pre>

<p>
The Kimura "2-parameter" model is almost as symmetric as this, but
allows for a difference between transition and transversion rates. Its
transition probability matrix for a short interval of time is:

<p>
<pre>

              To:     A        G        C        T
                   ---------------------------------
               A  | 1-a-2b     a         b       b
       From:   G  |   a      1-a-2b      b       b
               C  |   b        b       1-a-2b    a
               T  |   b        b         a     1-a-2b

</pre>

<p>
where a is u dt, the product of the rate of transitions per unit time
and dt is the length dt of the time interval, and b is v dt, the
product of half the rate of transversions (i.e., the rate of a
specific transversion) and the length dt of the time interval.

<p>
The F84 model incorporates different rates of transition and
transversion, but also allowing for different frequencies of the four
nucleotides. It is the model which is used in DNAML, the maximum
likelihood nucelotide sequence phylogenies program in this
package. You will find the model described in the document for that
program. The transition probabilities for this model are given by
Kishino and Hasegawa (1989), and further explained in a paper by me
and Gary Churchill (1996).

<p>
The LogDet distance allows a fairly general model of substitution. It
computes the distance from the determinant of the empirically observed
matrix of joint probabilities of nucleotides in the two species. An
explanation of it is available in the chapter by Swofford et,
al. (1996).

<p>
The first three models are closely related. The DNAML model reduces to
Kimura's two-parameter model if we assume that the equilibrium
frequencies of the four bases are equal. The Jukes-Cantor model in
turn is a special case of the Kimura 2-parameter model where a =
b. Thus each model is a special case of the ones that follow it,
Jukes-Cantor being a special case of both of the others.

<p>
The Jin and Nei (1990) correction for variation in rate of evolution
from site to site can be adapted to all of the first three models. It
assumes that the rate of substitution varies from site to site
according to a gamma distribution, with a coefficient of variation
that is specified by the user. The user is asked for it when choosing
this option in the menu.

<p>
Each distance that is calculated is an estimate, from that particular
pair of species, of the divergence time between those two species. For
the Jukes- Cantor model, the estimate is computed using the formula
for ut given above, as long as the nucleotide symbols in the two
sequences are all either A, C, G, T, U, N, X, ?, or - (the latter four
indicate a deletion or an unknown nucleotide. This estimate is a
maximum likelihood estimate for that model. For the Kimura 2-parameter
model, with only these nucleotide symbols, formulas special to that
estimate are also computed. These are also, in effect, computing the
maximum likelihood estimate for that model. In the Kimura case it
depends on the observed sequences only through the sequence length and
the observed number of transition and transversion differences between
those two sequences. The calculation in that case is a maximum
likelihood estimate and will differ somewhat from the estimate
obtained from the formulas in Kimura's original paper. That formula
was also a maximum likelihood estimate, but with the
transition/transversion ratio estimated empirically, separately for
each pair of sequences. In the present case, one overall preset
transition/transversion ratio is used which makes the computations
harder but achieves greater consistency between different comparisons.

<p>
For the F84 model, or for any of the models where one or both
sequences contain at least one of the other ambiguity codons such as
Y, R, etc., a maximum likelihood calculation is also done using code
which was originally written for DNAML. Its disadvantage is that it is
slow. The resulting distance is in effect a maximum likelihood
estimate of the divergence time (total branch length between) the two
sequences. However the present program will be much faster than
versions earlier than 3.5, because I have speeded up the iterations.

<p>
The LogDet model computes the distance from the determinant of the
matrix of co-occurrence of nucleotides in the two species, according
to the formula

<p>
<pre>
   D  = - 1/4(loge(|F|) - 1/2loge(fA1fC1fG1fT1fA2fC2fG2fT2))

</pre>
<p>
Where F is a matrix whose (i,j) element is the fraction of sites at
which base i occurs in one species and base j occurs in the other. fji
is the fraction of sites at which species i has base j. The LogDet
distance cannot cope with ambiguity codes. It must have completely
defined sequences. One limitation of the LogDet distance is that it
may be infinite sometimes, if there are too many changes between
certain pairs of nucleotides. This can be particularly noticeable with
distances computed from bootstrapped sequences.  Note that there is an
assumption that we are looking at all sites, including those that have
not changed at all. It is important not to restrict attention to some
sites based on whether or not they have changed; doing that would bias
the distances by making them too large, and that in turn would cause
the distances to misinterpret the meaning of those sites that had
changed.

<p>
For all of these distance methods, the program allows us to specify
that "third position" bases have a different rate of substitution than
first and second positions, that introns have a different rate than
exons, and so on. The Categories option which does this allows us to
make up to 9 categories of sites and specify different rates of change
for them.

<p>
In addition to the four distance calculations, the program can also
compute a table of similarities between nucleotide sequences. These
values are the fractions of sites identical between the sequences. The
diagonal values are 1.0000. No attempt is made to count similarity of
nonidentical nucleotides, so that no credit is given for having (for
example) different purines at corresponding sites in the two
sequences. This option has been requested by many users, who need it
for descriptive purposes. It is not intended that the table be used
for inferring the tree.

<b>fdnadist</b> output contains on its first line the number of
species. The distance matrix is then printed in standard form, with
each species starting on a new line with the species name, followed by
the distances to the species in order. These continue onto a new line
after every nine distances. If the L option is used, the matrix or
distances is in lower triangular form, so that only the distances to
the other species that precede each species are printed. Otherwise the
distance matrix is square with zero distances on the diagonal. In
general the format of the distance matrix is such that it can serve as
input to any of the distance matrix programs.

<p>
If the option to print out the data is selected, the output file will
precede the data by more complete information on the input and the
menu selections. The output file begins by giving the number of
species and the number of characters, and the identity of the distance
measure that is being used.

<p>
If the C (Categories) option is used a table of the relative rates of
expected substitution at each category of sites is printed, and a
listing of the categories each site is in.

<p>
There will then follow the equilibrium frequencies of the four
bases. If the Jukes-Cantor or Kimura distances are used, these will
necessarily be 0.25 : 0.25 : 0.25 : 0.25. The output then shows the
transition/transversion ratio that was specified or used by
default. In the case of the Jukes-Cantor distance this will always be
0.5. The transition-transversion parameter (as opposed to the ratio)
is also printed out: this is used within the program and can be
ignored. There then follow the data sequences, with the base sequences
printed in groups of ten bases along the lines of the Genbank and EMBL
formats.

<p>
The distances printed out are scaled in terms of expected numbers of
substitutions, counting both transitions and transversions but not
replacements of a base by itself, and scaled so that the average rate
of change, averaged over all sites analyzed, is set to 1.0 if there
are multiple categories of sites. This means that whether or not there
are multiple categories of sites, the expected fraction of change for
very small branches is equal to the branch length. Of course, when a
branch is twice as long this does not mean that there will be twice as
much net change expected along it, since some of the changes may occur
in the same site and overlie or even reverse each other. The branch
lengths estimates here are in terms of the expected underlying numbers
of changes. That means that a branch of length 0.26 is 26 times as
long as one which would show a 1% difference between the nucleotide
sequences at the beginning and end of the branch. But we would not
expect the sequences at the beginning and end of the branch to be 26%
different, as there would be some overlaying of changes.

<p>
One problem that can arise is that two or more of the species can be
so dissimilar that the distance between them would have to be
infinite, as the likelihood rises indefinitely as the estimated
divergence time increases. For example, with the Jukes-Cantor model,
if the two sequences differ in 75% or more of their positions then the
estimate of dovergence time would be infinite. Since there is no way
to represent an infinite distance in the output file, the program
regards this as an error, issues an error message indicating which
pair of species are causing the problem, and stops. It might be that,
had it continued running, it would have also run into the same problem
with other pairs of species. If the Kimura distance is being used
there may be no error message; the program may simply give a large
distance value (it is iterating towards infinity and the value is just
where the iteration stopped). Likewise some maximum likelihood
estimates may also become large for the same reason (the sequences
showing more divergence than is expected even with infinite branch
length). I hope in the future to add more warning messages that would
alert the user the this.

<p>
If the similarity table is selected, the table that is produced is not
in a format that can be used as input to the distance matrix
programs. it has a heading, and the species names are also put at the
tops of the columns of the table (or rather, the first 8 characters of
each species name is there, the other two characters omitted to save
space). There is not an option to put the table into a format that can
be read by the distance matrix programs, nor is there one to make it
into a table of fractions of difference by subtracting the similarity
values from 1. This is done deliberately to make it more difficult for
the use to use these values to construct trees. The similarity values
are not corrected for multiple changes, and their use to construct
trees (even after converting them to fractions of difference) would be
wrong, as it would lead to severe conflict between the distant pairs
of sequences and the close pairs of sequences.

This program is an EMBOSS conversion of a program written by Joe
Felsenstein as part of his PHYLIP package.

<p>
Although we take every care to ensure that the results of the EMBOSS
version are identical to those from the original package, we recommend
that you check your inputs give the same results in both versions
before publication.

<p>
Please report all bugs in the EMBOSS version to the EMBOSS bug team,
not to the original author.


<H2>
    History
