Finds programs sharing group names


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This program takes the name of an existing program in EMBOSS (or a
program in one the associated EMBASSY packages) and gives a list of the
programs which share some functionality with it. 

<p>
It does this by noting the functional groups that the program belongs to
and reporting any programs which share those functional groups.
<p>

The functional groups of a program are set in the ACD file (this is the
part of the program in the EMBOSS system which specifies the required
parameters, some help on the parameters, the one-line description of the
program, etc.) Normally the names of the groups are fairly specific,
such as: "NUCLEIC COMPOSITION", resulting in the reporting of only a
tightly restricted set of other programs also dealing with the analysis
of "NUCLEIC COMPOSITION".  The '-explode' qualifier will increase the
number of groups that the program belongs to by splitting the group name
at selected points to produce such groups as: "NUCLEIC", "NUCLEIC
COMPOSITION" and "COMPOSITION".  All programs with the exploded group
names which also include "NUCLEIC" and "COMPOSITION" will now be
reported.  The result of this qualifier is thus a report of a larger
number of programs with a more tenuous link to the specified program. 
In other words, use the '-explode' qualifier to decrease the specificity
of the search. 

<p>
The groups that the program belongs to can be output by using the
'-groups' qualifier.

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-search]            string     Enter the name of an EMBOSS program

   Optional qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -outfile            outfile    If you enter the name of a file here then
                                  this program will write the program names
                                  and brief descriptions into that file.
   -html               bool       If you are sending the output to a file,
                                  this will format it for displaying as a
                                  table in a WWW document.
*  -prelink            string     If you are outputting to a file in HTML
                                  format, you can make the program names into
                                  hyper-links by setting this to be the first
                                  half of the URL.
                                  For example, if you wish the program name to
                                  be a hyperlink to the URL:
                                  http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/
                                  programname.html
                                  then if you enter
                                  http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/
                                  here, then the first half of the URL before
                                  the program name will be set.
*  -postlink           string     If you are outputting to a file in HTML
                                  format, you can make the program names into
                                  hyper-links by setting this to be the second
                                  half of the URL.
                                  For example, if you wish the program name to
                                  be a hyperlink to the URL:
                                  http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/
                                  programname.html
                                  then if you enter '.html' here, the second
                                  half of the URL after the program name will
                                  be set.
   -groups             bool       If you use this option, then only the group
                                  names will output to the file
   -explode            bool       The groups that EMBOSS applications belong
                                  to have two forms, exploded and not
                                  exploded. The exploded group names are more
                                  numerous and often vaguely phrased than the
                                  non-exploded ones. The exploded names are
                                  formed from definitions of the group names
                                  that start like NAME1:NAME2 and which are
                                  then expanded into many combinations of the
                                  names as: 'NAME1', 'NAME2', 'NAME1 NAME2',
                                  NAME2 NAME1'. The non-expanded names are
                                  simply like: 'NAME1 NAME2'.
                                  Using expanded group names will find many
                                  more programs which share at least some of
                                  the expanded names than using the
                                  non-exploded names and so you will get more
                                  programs reported as sharing a similar
                                  function than you will if you specify that
                                  you wish to use non-exploded names

   Advanced qualifiers:
   -[no]emboss         bool       If you use this option then EMBOSS program
                                  documentation will be searched. If this
                                  option is set to be false, then only the
                                  EMBASSY programs will be searched (if the
                                  -embassy option is true). EMBASSY programs
                                  are not strictly part of EMBOSS, but use the
                                  same code libraries and share the same look
                                  and feel, but are generally developed by
                                  people who wish the programs to be outside
                                  of the GNU Public Licence scheme, ie. they
                                  may wish to charge money for them.
   -[no]embassy        bool       If you use this option then EMBASSY program
                                  documentation will be searched. If this
                                  option is set to be false, then only the
                                  EMBOSS programs will be searched (if the
                                  -emboss option is true). EMBASSY programs
                                  are not strictly part of EMBOSS, but use the

                                  of the GNU Public Licence scheme, ie. they
                                  may wish to charge money for them.
   -colon              bool       The groups that EMBOSS applications belong
                                  to have up to two levels, for example the
                                  primary group 'ALIGNMENT' has several
                                  sub-groups, or second-level groups, e.g.:
                                  CONSENSUS, DIFFERENCES, DOT PLOTS, GLOBAL,
                                  LOCAL, MULTIPLE. To aid programs that parse
                                  the output of seealso that require the names
                                  of these subgroups, a colon ':' will be
                                  placed between the first and second level of
                                  the group name if this option is true.

   General qualifiers:
  -help                bool       report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
