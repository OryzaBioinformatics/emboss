Counts the composition of dimer/trimer/etc words in a sequence


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


This takes a specified length of sequence and counts the number of
distinct subsequences of that length that there are in the input
sequence(s).

It can read in the result of a previous compseq analysis and use this
to set the expected frequencies of the subsequences.

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>


Here is a sample session with compseq.

<pre>

To count the frequencies of dinucleotides in a file:

% compseq  embl:hsfau  2  result3.comp 

To count the frequencies of hexanucleotides, without outputting
the results of hexanucleotides that do not occur in the sequence:

% compseq  embl:hsfau  6  result6.comp  -nozero

To count the frequencies of trinucleotides in frame 2 of a sequence
and use a previously prepared compseq output to show the expected
frequencies:

% compseq  embl:hsfau  3  result3.comp  -frame 2  -in prev.comp

</pre>

  [-word]              integer    This is the size of word (n-mer) to count.
                                  Thus if you want to count codon frequencies,
                                  you should enter 3 here.
  [-outfile]           outfile    This is the results file.

   Optional qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -infile             infile     This is a file previously produced by
                                  'compseq' that can be used to set the
                                  expected frequencies of words in this
                                  analysis.
                                  The word size in the current run must be the
                                  same as the one in this results file.
                                  Obviously, you should use a file produced
                                  from protein sequences if you are counting
                                  protein sequence word frequencies, and you
                                  must use one made from nucleotide
                                  frequencies if you and analysing a
                                  nucleotide sequence.
   -[no]zerocount      bool       You can make the output results file much
                                  smaller if you do not display the words with
                                  a zero count.
   -frame              integer    The normal behaviour of 'compseq' is to
                                  count the frequencies of all words that
                                  occur by moving a window of length 'word' up
                                  by one each time.
                                  This option allows you to move the window up
                                  by the length of the word each time,
                                  skipping over the intervening words.
                                  You can count only those words that occur in
                                  a single frame of the word by setting this
                                  value to a number other than zero.
                                  If you set it to 1 it will only count the
                                  words in frame 1, 2 will only count the
                                  words in frame 2 and so on.
*  -[no]ignorebz       bool       The amino acid code B represents Asparagine
                                  or Aspartic acid and the code Z represents
                                  Glutamine or Glutamic acid.
                                  These are not commonly used codes and you
                                  may wish not to count words containing them,
                                  just noting them in the count of 'Other'
                                  words.
*  -reverse            bool       Set this to be false if you do not wish to
                                  also count words in the reverse complement
                                  of the sequence.

    Input file format
</H2>


Normal sequence(s) USA.

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


The output format consists of:
<p>
Header information and comments are preceeded by a '#' character
at the start of the line.
<p>
The Word size and the Total count are then given on separate lines,
<p>
The headers of the columns of results are preceeded by a '#'
<p>
The results columns are: the sub-sequence word, the observed
frequency, the expected frequency (which will be read from the input
file if one is given, else it is a simple inverse of the number of words
of the size specified that can be constructed), the ratio of the
observed to expected frequency.
<p>
After a blank line at the end, the results of 'Other' words is
given - this is the number of words with a sequence which has
IUPAC ambiguity codes or other unusual characters in. 
<p>
Example:

#
# Output from 'compseq'

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>


The input data file is not required.
<p>
The input data file format is exactly the same as the output
file format. 
<p>
It expects to read in a previous output file of this program.
An error is produced if the word size of the current compseq job
and that of the output file being read in are different.

<H2>
    Notes
</H2>


The results are held in an array in memory before being written
to a file.  For large values of wordsize, you may run out of memory.
<p>
You can produce very large output files if you choose large values
of wordsize.

    Exit status
</H2>


It always exits with status 0 unless one of the above error conditions
is found

<H2>
    Known bugs
</H2>


This program can use a large amount of memory is you specify a large
word size (7 or above).  This may impact the behaviour of other programs
on your machine. 

<p>
If you run out of memory, you may see the program crash with a generic
error message that will be specific to your machine's operating system,
but will probably be a warning about writing to memory that the program
does not own (eg "Segmentation fault" on a Solaris machine)

<p>
This is not a bug, it is a feature of the way this program grabs large
amounts of memory.
