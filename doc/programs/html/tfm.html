    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.

        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will
        do what he wants. 

        Long description.

        Why it is useful.

        When it should/shouldn't be used.

        Algorithms

        Expanded description.

        eg: Reverse engineers Wheedle's 'talpsgob' program. This does a 
        splurge of the 5' end of the sequence followed by a durm.
        The net effect is a 5' end splurt.
        etc. for as long as is required (several pages is not unreasonable)
  -->

This program displays the help documentation for an EMBOSS program.
<P>

The contributors of the EMBOSS programs do attempt to provide an adequate
description of the programs. This documentation is primarily held as HTML pages
at
<A HREF="http://www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/">http://www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/</A>

<P>
The documentation is also available however through the program
<B>tfm</B> as normal text.

<P>
<B>tfm</B> is unusual for an EMBOSS program in that it expects to be used
interactively and so it displays the documentation text a page at a time,
pausing after every page for the user to proess the <B>SPACE</B> bar on
their keyboard. (i.e. it uses the UNIX program <B>more</B> to display the
information). This behaviour can be turned off by using the qualifier
<b>-nomore</b>.


 
<P>
If you have problems understanding the function
or usage of an EMBOSS program, then you should contact the EMBOSS mailing
list (emboss@embnet.org).

<P>
The unusual name of this program comes from the common computing science
expression: <b>RTFM</B>. This acronym, as you probably already know, stands for
<B>Read The Fine* Manual</B>; so this is <B>The Fine* Manual</B>.
<P>

* Insert the expletive of your choice here!

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.
 -->


Here is a sample session with tfm:

<pre>

% tfm wossname

</pre>


You will see a page of documentation on the <b>wossname</B> program.
To see further pages, you should press the <B>SPACE</B> bar on your keyboard.
To stop seeing the documentation before you get to the end of the text, you
can press the key <b>q</b> to quit.

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.

        eg:
        data file format:

	blank lines and comment lines are ignored.
        comment lines start with '#'
        There are three columns separated by one or more space or TAB
	characters for X and Y values of durm, followed by energy
        all coefficients are given as floating point values
        An example is:

        # Durm coefficient enery file
        # X     Y       Energy
        0.1     0.2     0.331
        0.2     0.4     0.332
        0.3     0.6     0.333

<!-- 
        Potentially stupid things the program will let you do.

    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

<!-- 
        Error messages specific to this program.
        eg:

        "Threshold value greater than 1." - means that the threshold has
        been set to be greater than 1 but a burgle exception has
        occurred making this invalid - you should reduce the wobble
        parameter and try again. 

   -->
   
tfm will warn you if you have supplied the name of a program which is not
documented yet or which doesn't exist in EMBOSS.

<!-- 
        Description of the exit status for various error conditions
