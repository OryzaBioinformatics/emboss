<H2>
    Description
</H2>

This program displays the help documentation for an EMBOSS program.
<P>

The contributors of the EMBOSS programs do attempt to provide an adequate
description of the programs. This documentation for your current
release is included as HTML pages in the EMBOSS distribution and
may be available at your site. The
latest documentation for the next release is provided by the
developers at
<A HREF="/apps/">http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/</A>

<P>
The release documentation is also available however through the program
<B>tfm</B> as normal text.

<P>

If you have problems understanding the function
or usage of an EMBOSS program, then you should contact the EMBOSS mailing
list (emboss@embnet.org).

<P>

The unusual name of this program comes from the common computing science
expression: <b>RTFM</B>. This acronym, as you probably already know, stands for
<B>Read The Fine* Manual</B>; so this is <B>The Fine* Manual</B>.

<P>

* Insert the expletive of your choice here!

<H3>Paged text output to the screen</H3>

<B>tfm</B> is unusual for an EMBOSS program in that it expects to be used
interactively and so it displays the documentation text a page at a time,
pausing after every page for the user to press the <B>SPACE</B> bar on
their keyboard. (i.e. it uses the UNIX program <B>more</B> to display the
information). This behaviour can be turned off by using the qualifier
<b>-nomore</b>.

<P>

The text is paged to the screen using the UNIX program 'more'.  The
program 'more' is a very standard way for text files to be displayed in
UNIX.  You might, however, prefer the text to be displayed using other
programs, for example 'less' (which has more functionality than 'more'
and is used by many people).  The UNIX environment variable 'PAGER'
can be set to hold the name of your preferred program.  If you have
PAGER set, then <b>tfm</b> will use this specified program instead of
using the default 'more' program.  (If you want <b>tfm</b> to use a
specified program that is different to the normal 'PAGER' program, then
'PAGER' can be overriden by setting the environment variable
'EMBOSS_PAGER' to hold the name of the program that should only be used
to display text in <b>tfm</b>). 

<p>

'PAGER' can be set in UNIX by a command like:
<br>
setenv PAGER less

<p>

To get help on 'more' when using it to display text, press the '?' key.
<BR>
To get help on 'less' when using it to display text, press the 'h' key.

Function

   Finds programs by keywords in their one-line documentation

Description

   This allows a user to search for keywords or parts of words in the
   brief documentation (as displayed by a program when it first starts).
   The program name and the brief description is output. If no words to
   search for are specified, then details of all the EMBOSS programs are
   output.

   The program has been written on the assumption that most people will
   use it to quickly find the name of a program based on that program's
   description, so the output goes to the screen by default.

   This program may find some use in automatically generating lists of
   EMBOSS programs and their groups for Web pages.

Input file format

   wossname reads the brief descriptions and the program groups from the
   ACD files. (ACD files control the parameters that the programs expect
   - don't worry about them unless you are writing EMBOSS programs).

   The format of ACD files is documented elsewhere.

Output file format

   The results are written out as a simple list preceded by the group
   that the programs belong to or the word that is being searched for.

   Program name Description
   embossdata Finds or fetches the data files read in by the EMBOSS
   programs
   embossversion Writes the current EMBOSS version number

   If the -html, -prelink and -postlink qualifiers are specified, then
   the output will be wrapped in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web
   page. Note that tags such as <HTML>, <BODY>, </BODY> and </HTML> are
   not output by this program as the list of programs is expected to form
   only part of the contents of a web page - the rest of the web page
   must be supplied by the user.

Data files

   As noted above, the program ACD files are searched. The average user
   will not need to worry about this.

Notes

   If a program's ACD file does not assign the program to a group, it
   will be automatically assigned to the group 'ASSORTED'.

   A program can belong to more than one group.

   The name of this program comes from its use as a favorite word of the
   author Terry Pratchett. It is used especially by the characters of the
   parrot in Eric and the dog Gaspode in Moving Pictures and Men at Arms.
