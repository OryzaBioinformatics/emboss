Plot CpG rich areas


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


CpG refers to a C nucleotide immediately followed by a G.  The 'p' in
'CpG' refers to the phosphate group linking the two bases. 

<p>
Detection of regions of genomic sequences that are rich in the CpG
pattern is important because such regions are resistant to methylation
and tend to be associated with genes which are frequently switched on. 
Regions rich in the CpG pattern are known as CpG islands.  

<p>
It has been estimated that about half of all mammalian genes have a
CpG-rich region around their 5' end.  It is said that all mammalian
house-keeping genes have a CpG island!

<p>
Non-mammalian vertebrates have some CpG islands that are associated with
genes, but the association gets equivocal in the farther taxonomic
groups. 

<p>
Finding a CpG island upstream of predicted exons or genes is good
contributory evidence. 

<p>
By default, this program defines a CpG island as a region where, over an
average of 10 windows, the calculated % composition is over 50% and the
calculated Obs/Exp ratio is over 0.6 and the conditions hold for a
minimum of 200 bases.  These conditions can be modified by setting the
values of the appropriate parameters. 

<p>
The Expected number of CpG patterns in a window is calculated as the
number of 'C's in the window multiplied by the number of 'G's in the
window, divided by the window length. 

<p>
This program reads in one or more sequences and calculates the Obs/Exp
ratio, the percentage CpG over a window which is moved along the
sequence.  These calculated values can be plotted, together with the
regions which match this program's definition of a CpG island. 

<H2>

     Length &gt; 200

 Length 233 (157..389)

 Length 310 (654..963)

</pre>

<p>
The first non-blank line of the output file is the title of the output
file.  It is followed by the name of the sequence and the region
analysed (from the centre of the first window to the centre of the last
window).  The conditions for specifying a CpG island follow
(Observed/Expected ratio, Percent C + Percent G, Length).

<p>
The length and start and end positions of any predicted CpG islands are
then output.
