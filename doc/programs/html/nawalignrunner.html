<table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=3 BGCOLOR="#f5f5ff" ><tr><td>
<pre>
   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-seqpairsdir]       dirlist    Input directory of files containing sequence
                                  pairs for alignment
  [-commandpath]       directory  Directory where alignment executable lives
  [-commandname]       string     Name of alignment executable
  [-scoringmatrixdir]  directory  Directory where scoring matrix lives
  [-scoringmatrixname] string     Name of alignment scoring matrix
   -gapopen            float      The gap opening penalty is subtracted from
                                  the total score every time a gap is inserted
                                  in the alignment. The default value is
                                  chosen for the EBLOSUM62 scoring matrix when
                                  you are aligning protein sequences, and the
                                  EDNAFULL matrix when you are aligning
                                  nucleotide sequences. If you sequence
                                  contains many small errors you should set a
                                  low gap opening penalty (near zero) to avoid
                                  over-penalizing those errors.
   -gapextend          float      The gap extension penalty is the score
                                  substracted when more spaces are added to an
                                  existing alignment gap. Often a single
                                  insertion or deletion affects multiple
                                  residues/nucleotides; separate opening and
                                  extension penalties reduce the excessive
                                  penalty such events would otherwise carry;
                                  generally the gap extension penalty should
                                  be significantly lower than the gap opening
                                  penalty.
  [-alignedseqsoutdir] outdir     Name of directory containing sequences
                                  aligned by nawalign
  [-outfilesuffix]     string     Appended to end of all output alignment file
                                  names
  [-outfileformat]     string     Format of output alignments
