Finds restriction enzyme cleavage sites


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


Restrict uses the REBASE database of restriction enzymes to predict
cut sites in a DNA sequence. The program allows you to select a range
of cuts, whether the DNA is circular, whether IUB ambiguity codes are
used, whether blunt or sticky ends or both are reported. You may also
force the reporting of single cleavage sites.

<p>

By default, only one of any group of isoschizomers (enzymes that have the
same recognition site and cut positions) is reported (this behaviour can
be turned off by setting the qualifier '-limit' to be false.) The reported
enzyme from any one group of isoschizomers (the prototype) is specified in
the REBASE database and the information is held in the data file 'embossre.equ'.
You may edit this file to set your own preferred prototype,if you wish.

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
   -sitelen            integer    This sets the minimum length of the
                                  restriction enzyme recognition site. Any
                                  enzymes with sites shorter than this will be
                                  ignored.
   -enzymes            string     The name 'all' reads in all enzyme names
                                  from the REBASE database. You can specify
                                  enzymes by giving their names with commas
                                  between then, such as:
                                  'HincII,hinfI,ppiI,hindiii'.
                                  The case of the names is not important. You
                                  can specify a file of enzyme names to read
                                  in by giving the name of the file holding
                                  the enzyme names with a '@' character in
                                  front of it, for example, '@enz.list'.
                                  Blank lines and lines starting with a hash
                                  character or '!' are ignored and all other
                                  lines are concatenated together with a comma
                                  character ',' and then treated as the list
                                  of enzymes to search for.
                                  An example of a file of enzyme names is:

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -min                integer    This sets the minimum number of cuts for any
                                  restriction enzyme that will be considered.
                                  Any enzymes that cut fewer times than this
                                  will be ignored.
   -max                integer    This sets the maximum number of cuts for any
                                  restriction enzyme that will be considered.
                                  Any enzymes that cut more times than this
                                  will be ignored.
   -solofragment       boolean    This gives the fragment lengths of the
                                  forward sense strand produced by complete
                                  restriction by each restriction enzyme on it
                                  own. Results are added to the tail section
                                  of the report.
   -single             boolean    If this is set then this forces the values
                                  of the mincuts and maxcuts qualifiers to
                                  both be 1. Any other value you may have set
                                  them to will be ignored.
   -[no]blunt          boolean    This allows those enzymes which cut at the
                                  same position on the forward and reverse
                                  strands to be considered.
   -[no]sticky         boolean    This allows those enzymes which cut at
                                  different positions on the forward and
                                  reverse strands, leaving an overhang, to be
                                  considered.
   -[no]ambiguity      boolean    This allows those enzymes which have one or
                                  more 'N' ambiguity codes in their pattern to
                                  be considered
   -plasmid            boolean    If this is set then this allows searches for
                                  restriction enzyme recognition site and cut
                                  postions that span the end of the sequence
                                  to be considered.
   -[no]commercial     boolean    If this is set, then only those enzymes with
                                  a commercial supplier will be searched for.
                                  This qualifier is ignored if you have
                                  specified an explicit list of enzymes to
                                  search for, rather than searching through
                                  'all' the enzymes in the REBASE database. It
                                  is assumed that, if you are asking for an
                                  explicit enzyme, then you probably know
                                  where to get it from and so all enzymes
                                  names that you have asked to be searched
                                  for, and which cut, will be reported whether
                                  or not they have a commercial supplier.
   -datafile           string     Alternative RE data file
   -[no]limit          boolean    This limits the reporting of enzymes to just
                                  one enzyme from each group of
                                  isoschizomers. The enzyme chosen to
                                  represent an isoschizomer group is the
                                  prototype indicated in the data file
                                  'embossre.equ', which is created by the
                                  program 'rebaseextract'. If you prefer
                                  different prototypes to be used, make a copy
                                  of embossre.equ in your home directory and
                                  edit it. If this value is set to be false
                                  then all of the input enzymes will be
                                  reported. You might like to set this to
                                  false if you are supplying an explicit set
                                  of enzymes rather than searching 'all' of
                                  them.
   -alphabetic         boolean    Sort output alphabetically
   -fragments          boolean    This gives the fragment lengths of the
                                  forward sense strand produced by complete
                                  restriction using all of the input enzymes
                                  together. Results are added to the tail

    Output file format
</H2>


<p>

The output is a standard EMBOSS report file. 

<p>

The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
command-line qualifier <b>-rformat xxx</b>, where 'xxx' is replaced by
the name of the required format.  The available format names are: embl,
genbank, gff, pir, swiss, trace, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq, excel,
feattable, motif, regions, seqtable, simple, srs, table, tagseq

<p>

See:
<A href="http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Themes/ReportFormats.html">
http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Themes/ReportFormats.html</A>
for further information on report formats.

<p>


<p>

By default <b>restrict</b> writes a 'table' report file.

<p>

The output from restrict is a simple text one. The base number,
restriction enzyme name, recognition site and cut positions are
shown. Note that cuts are always to the right of the residue
shown and that 5' cuts are referred to by their associated 3'
number sequence.

<p>

The program reports enzymes that cut at two or four sites. The
program also reports isoschizomers and enzymes having the same
recognition sequence but different cut sites.


<p>

When the "-fragments" or "-solofragments" qualifiers are given then the sizes of
the fragments produced by either all of the specified enzymes cutting, or
by each enzyme cutting individually, are given in the 'tail' section
at the end of the report file.

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

This uses the EMBOSS REBASE data files in 'data/REBASE/*' under the
EMBOSS installation directory.

<p>
These files must first be set up using the program <a
href="rebaseextract.html">'rebaseextract'.</a> Running
'rebaseextract' may be the job of your system manager.  

<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
<p>



The data files are stored in the REBASE directory of the standard EMBOSS
data directory. The names are:

<ul>
   <li> embossre.enz     Cleavage information
   <li> embossre.ref     Reference/methylation information
   <li> embossre.sup     Supplier information
</ul>

The column information is described at the top of the data files

<p>

The reported
enzyme from any one group of isoschizomers (the prototype) is specified in
the REBASE database and the information is held in the data file 'embossre.equ'.
You may edit this file to set your own preferred prototype, if you wish.

<p>

The format of the file "embossre.equ" is 
<br>
Enzyme-name Prototype-name

<p>

i.e. two columns of enzyme names separated by a space. The first name of the
pair of enzymes is the name that is not preferred and the second is the
preferred, prototype name.


<H2>
    Notes
</H2>


Output file size is related to the size of the recognition site and the
maximum number of allowed cutting positions. Setting the site length
to six and restricting the cuts to two is a common choice of parameters.
The size of the output can sometimes be reduced by specifying
the -noambiguity switch.
<p>

The data files must have been created before running this program. This is
done by running the <b>rebaseextract</b> program with the "withrefm" and "prot" 
files from an REBASE release. You may have to ask your system manager to do this.
