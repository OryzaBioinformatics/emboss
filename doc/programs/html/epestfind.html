<b>epestfind</b> allows rapid and objective identification of PEST motifs
in protein target sequences.  Briefly, the PEST hypothesis was based on
a literature survey that combined both information on protein stability
as well as protein primary sequence information.  Initially, the study
relied on 12 short-lived proteins with well-known properties [1], but
was continually extended later [2,3].  The initial group of proteins
included E1A, c-myc, p53, c-fos, v-myb, P730 phytochrome, heat shock
protein 70 (HSP 70), HMG-CoA reductase, tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT),
ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), alpha-Casein and beta-Casein.  Although
all these proteins exerted various different cellular functions it
became apparent that they shared high local concentrations of amino
acids proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), threonine (T) and to a
lesser extent aspartic acid (D).  From that it was concluded that PEST
motifs reduce the half-lives of proteins dramatically and hence, that
they target proteins for proteolytic degradation.  


<p>

PEST means Black Death in German, so that the name of this programme
sounds a bit strange, at least in our ears. 









<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

<!--

  -->

PEST motifs were defined as hydrophilic stretches of at least 12 amino
acids length with a high local concentration of critical amino acids. 
Remarkably, negatively charged amino acids are clustered within these
motifs while positively charged amino acids, arginine (R), histidine (H)
and lysine (K) are generally forbidden. 

<p>

The <b>epestfind</b> algorithm defines the last criterion even more
stringently in that PEST motifs are required to be flanked by positively
charged amino acids.  Though this implication greatly facilitates
computer scanning, a few PEST sequences might be missed.  Especially
sequences with a high local concentration of critical amino acids but
with a long distance between positively charged amino acids are error
prone.  Due to their length, these PEST motifs might become diluted,
which results in scores apparently lower than initially expected. 
Another side effect of scanning for positively charged amino acids is
that very long PEST motifs are sub-divided into adjacent smaller ones. 
However, identification of PEST motifs is achieved by an initial scan
for positively charged amino acids arginine (R), histidine (H) and
lysine (K) within the specified protein sequence.  All amino acids
between the positively charged flanks are counted and only those motifs
are considered further, which contain a number of amino acids equal to
or higher than the window-size parameter.  Additionally, all 'valid'
PEST regions are required to contain at least one proline (P), one
aspartate (D) or glutamate (E) and at least one serine (S) or
threonine(T).  Sequences that do not meet the above criteria are
classified as 'invalid' PEST motifs and excluded from further analysis. 

<p>

The quality of 'valid' PEST motifs is refined by means of a scoring
parameter based on the local enrichment of critical amino acids as well
as the motif's hydrophobicity.  Enrichment of D, E, P, S and T is
expressed in mass percent (w/w) and corrected for one equivalent of D or
E, one of P and one of S or T.  Calculation of hydrophobicity follows in
principle the method of J.  Kyte and R.F.  Doolittle [4].  For
simplified calculations, Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy indices, which
originally ranged from -4.5 for arginine to +4.5 for isoleucine, were
converted to positive integers.  This was achieved by the following
linear transformation, which yielded values from 0 for arginine to 90
for isoleucine. 

<p>

      <center>Hydropathy index = 10 * Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy index + 45</center>

<p>

The motif's hydrophobicity is calculated as the sum over the products of
mole percent and hydrophobicity index for each amino acid species.  The
desired PEST score is obtained as combination of local enrichment term
and hydrophobicity term as expressed by the following equation:

<p>

      <center>PEST score = 0.55 * DEPST - 0.5 * hydrophobicity index.</center>

<p>

Although, the formula above differs from the publication [1], it is in
fact the correct one, which was also implemented in the original BASIC
programme (personal communication).  In addition, the programme includes
a correction for the hydropathy index of tyrosine, introduced by Robert
H.  Stellwagen from the University of Southern California.  However,
PEST scores can range from -45 for poly-isoleucine to about +50 for
poly-aspartate plus one proline and one serine.  'Valid' PEST motifs
below the threshold score (5.0) are considered as 'poor', while PEST
scores above the threshold score are of real biological interest.  The
higher the PEST score, the more likely is degradation of proteins
mediated via 'potential' PEST motifs in eukaryotic cells. 

<p>

Presently, all modified Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy indices are
hard-coded into the programme, which might change in future.

<p>

The array of linear transformed Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy
indices (ltkdhi) is listed in alphabetical order below.
(A-M and N-Z as well as N-terminus and C-terminus)

<p>

63, 10, 70, 10, 10, 72, 41, 13, 90,  0,  6, 82, 64,
10,  0, 29, 10,  0, 36, 38,  0, 87, 36, 45, 58, 10,
 0,  0

<p>

The linear transformation was ltkdhi = 10 * kdhi + 45
<br>
All values range from Argine R = 0 to Isoleucine I = 90
<br>
B=(N|D)=10 since N=10 and D=10
<br>
Z=(Q|E)=10 since Q=10 and E=10
<br>
X=10*0+45=45

    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.

	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
   -->

The physico-chemical properties of the residues are read from the EMBOSS
data file 'Eamino.dat'.  This file can be copied into your current
directory and inspected or altered by using the application 'embossdata
-fetch'.  Another file can be specified using the qualifier '-aadata'. 

<p>


<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
<p>


<p>

Here is the default Eamino.dat file:
