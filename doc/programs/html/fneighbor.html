<H2>
    Description
</H2>

An implementation by Mary Kuhner and John Yamato of Saitou and Nei's
"Neighbor Joining Method," and of the UPGMA (Average Linkage
clustering) method. Neighbor Joining is a distance matrix method
producing an unrooted tree without the assumption of a clock. UPGMA
does assume a clock. The branch lengths are not optimized by the least
squares criterion but the methods are very fast and thus can handle
much larger data sets.


<H2>
    Algorithm
</H2>

This program implements the Neighbor-Joining method of Saitou and Nei
(1987) and the UPGMA method of clustering. The program was written by
Mary Kuhner and Jon Yamato, using some code from program FITCH. An
important part of the code was translated from FORTRAN code from the
neighbor-joining program written by Naruya Saitou and by Li Jin, and
is used with the kind permission of Drs. Saitou and Jin.

<p>
NEIGHBOR constructs a tree by successive clustering of lineages,
setting branch lengths as the lineages join. The tree is not
rearranged thereafter. The tree does not assume an evolutionary clock,
so that it is in effect an unrooted tree. It should be somewhat
similar to the tree obtained by FITCH. The program cannot evaluate a
User tree, nor can it prevent branch lengths from becoming
negative. However the algorithm is far faster than FITCH or
KITSCH. This will make it particularly effective in their place for
large studies or for bootstrap or jackknife resampling studies which
require runs on multiple data sets.

<p>
The UPGMA option constructs a tree by successive (agglomerative)
clustering using an average-linkage method of clustering. It has some
relationship to KITSCH, in that when the tree topology turns out the
same, the branch lengths with UPGMA will turn out to be the same as
with the P = 0 option of KITSCH.

<p>
The programs FITCH, KITSCH, and NEIGHBOR are for dealing with data
which comes in the form of a matrix of pairwise distances between all
pairs of taxa, such as distances based on molecular sequence data,
gene frequency genetic distances, amounts of DNA hybridization, or
immunological distances. In analyzing these data, distance matrix
programs implicitly assume that:

<ul>

<li>
Each distance is measured independently from the others: no item of
data contributes to more than one distance.

<li>
The distance between each pair of taxa is drawn from a distribution
with an expectation which is the sum of values (in effect amounts of
evolution) along the tree from one tip to the other. The variance of
the distribution is proportional to a power p of the expectation.

</ul>

<p>
These assumptions can be traced in the least squares methods of
programs FITCH and KITSCH but it is not quite so easy to see them in
operation in the Neighbor-Joining method of NEIGHBOR, where the
independence assumptions is less obvious.

<p>
THESE TWO ASSUMPTIONS ARE DUBIOUS IN MOST CASES: independence will not
be expected to be true in most kinds of data, such as genetic
distances from gene frequency data. For genetic distance data in which
pure genetic drift without mutation can be assumed to be the mechanism
of change CONTML may be more appropriate. However, FITCH, KITSCH, and
NEIGHBOR will not give positively misleading results (they will not
make a statistically inconsistent estimate) provided that additivity
holds, which it will if the distance is computed from the original
data by a method which corrects for reversals and parallelisms in
evolution. If additivity is not expected to hold, problems are more
severe. A short discussion of these matters will be found in a review
article of mine (1984a). For detailed, if sometimes irrelevant,
controversy see the papers by Farris (1981, 1985, 1986) and myself
(1986, 1988b).

<p>
For genetic distances from gene frequencies, FITCH, KITSCH, and
NEIGHBOR may be appropriate if a neutral mutation model can be assumed
and Nei's genetic distance is used, or if pure drift can be assumed
and either Cavalli-Sforza's chord measure or Reynolds, Weir, and
Cockerham's (1983) genetic distance is used. However, in the latter
case (pure drift) CONTML should be better.

<p>
Restriction site and restriction fragment data can be treated by
distance matrix methods if a distance such as that of Nei and Li
(1979) is used. Distances of this sort can be computed in PHYLIp by
the program RESTDIST.

<p>
For nucleic acid sequences, the distances computed in DNADIST allow
correction for multiple hits (in different ways) and should allow one
to analyse the data under the presumption of additivity. In all of
these cases independence will not be expected to hold. DNA
hybridization and immunological distances may be additive and
independent if transformed properly and if (and only if) the standards
against which each value is measured are independent. (This is rarely
exactly true).

<p>
FITCH and the Neighbor-Joining option of NEIGHBOR fit a tree which has
the branch lengths unconstrained. KITSCH and the UPGMA option of
NEIGHBOR, by contrast, assume that an "evolutionary clock" is valid,
according to which the true branch lengths from the root of the tree
to each tip are the same: the expected amount of evolution in any
lineage is proportional to elapsed time.

<b>fneighbor</b> output consists of an tree (rooted if UPGMA, unrooted
if Neighbor-Joining) and the lengths of the interior segments. The
Average Percent Standard Deviation is not computed or printed out. If
the tree found by Neighbor is fed into FITCH as a User Tree, it will
compute this quantity if one also selects the N option of FITCH to
ensure that none of the branch lengths is re-estimated.

<p>
As NEIGHBOR runs it prints out an account of the successive clustering
levels, if you allow it to. This is mostly for reassurance and can be
suppressed using menu option 2. In this printout of cluster levels the
word "OTU" refers to a tip species, and the word "NODE" to an interior
node of the resulting tree.
