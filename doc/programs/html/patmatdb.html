Search a protein sequence with a motif


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


Takes a protein motif and compares it to a set of protein sequences. 

<p>

It returns the number of matches there were between the motif and each
matched sequence, length of match, start and end positions of match, and
writes out an alignment. 

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>


Here is a sample session with patmatdb.

<p>

<pre>
% patmatdb
Search a protein sequence with a motif
Input sequence(s): sw:*
Protein motif to search for: st[ty]s
Output file [5h1d_fugru.patmatdb]:
</pre>

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

It reads in one or more protein sequences.

<p>

Patterns for patmatdb are based on the format of pattern used in the
PROSITE database, with the difference that the terminating dot '.' and
the hyphens, '-', between the characters are optional.

<p>

The PROSITE pattern definition from the PROSITE documentation follows. 

<ul>
<li> The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the amino acids are used.

<li> The symbol `x' is used for a position where any amino acid is
accepted.

<li> Ambiguities are indicated by listing the acceptable amino acids
      for a given position, between square parentheses `[ ]'. For
      example: [ALT] stands for Ala or Leu or Thr.

<li> Ambiguities are also indicated by listing between a pair of curly
      brackets `{ }' the amino acids that are not accepted at a given
      position. For example: {AM} stands for any amino acid except Ala
      and Met.

<li> Each element in a pattern is separated from its neighbor by a
      `-'.  (Optional in patmatdb).

<li> Repetition of an element of the pattern can be indicated by
      following that element with a numerical value or a numerical
      range between parenthesis. Examples: x(3) corresponds to x-x-x,
      x(2,4) corresponds to x-x or x-x-x or x-x-x-x.

<li> When a pattern is restricted to either the N- or C-terminal of a
      sequence, that pattern either starts with a `&lt;' symbol or
      respectively ends with a `&gt;' symbol.

<li> A period ends the pattern. (Optional in patmatdb).

</ul>

<p>

For example, in SWISSPROT entry 100K_RAT you can look for the pattern: 

<p>

<pre>
[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C
</pre>

<p>

This means: Two Asps or Glus in any order followed by His, Ser, any residue
other then Pro, then two of any residue followed by Pro followed by two to four
of any residue followed by Cys. 

<p>

The search is case-independent, so 'AAA' matches 'aaa'. 

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


The output from the above example follows:

<p>

<hr>
<pre>
Number of matches found in HD_FUGRU = 1
Length of the sequence = 3148 basepairs
Length of match = 4
Start of match = position 1037 of sequence
End of match = position 1040 of sequence

patmatDB of HD_FUGRU from 1037 to 1040 using pattern st[ty]s

Number of matches found in GCN4_YEAST = 1

End of match = position 160 of sequence

<a href="fuzzpro.html">fuzzpro</a> - Protein pattern search 
<br>
This does much the same is patmatdb, but has a slightly different style
of output and allows mismatches. 

<p>

<a href="patmatmotifs.html">patmatmotifs</a> - Compares a protein
sequence to the PROSITE motif database.
<br>
This does the opposite to patmatdb, comparing a database of motifs to
one sequence.
