<b>degapseq</b> reads in one or more sequences and writes them out again
minus any gap characters.  In effect it removes gaps from aligned
sequences. 

<p>

In fact, if does more than just this as it removes <b>ANY</b>
non-alphabetic character from the input sequence, so as well as removing
the gap-characters, it will remove such things as the '*' in protein
sequenecs that indicates the position of a 'translated' STOP codon. 

<p>

There are many different formats for storing sequences in files.  Some
sequence formats allow you to store aligned sequences, including the
information on where gaps have been introduced to make the sequence
align properly.  This is indicated by using a special character to
indicate that there is a gap at that position.  Different sequence
formats use different characters to indicate gaps.  Some formats may use
more than one type of character to indicate different types of gaps
(e.g.  gaps at the ends of the sequences, internal gaps, gaps introduced
by a program or by a person editing the alignment, etc.) Some typicate
characters used to indicate where gaps are may be: '.', '-' and '~'. 

<p>

When EMBOSS programs read in a sequence that has gap-characters in, all
gap characters are internally changed to '-' characters.  i.e.  EMBOSS
only has one type of gap character.  Thus any distinguishing characters
for different gap types are reduced to a '-'.  There is only one type of
gap in EMBOSS. 

<p>

<b>degapseq</b> removes any non-alphabetic character in the sequence, in
effect this means that gaps and '*' characters are removed.  The
sequence is then written out.

    Usage

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.

Here is a sample session with degapseq:

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

Any valid input sequence USA is allowed.

<p>

The input sequence can be nucleic or protein.

<p>

The input sequence can be gapped or ungapped.

<p>

An example of a sequence with gaps might be:

<p>

<pre>
>dgshsh
ATGCGCAGGTACGTATG....CTGACGGTACGTGATCGA-GCTGA-CGAGCGTATGC-----
>hsf1
--------TGACTGATGCTGA~~~~CTG-ACGTGACTGATGCTGATCGTGACTGATCGTGAC
>myclone1
ATGCGCAGGTACGTATGCTGACGGTACGTGATCGA-GCTGA-CGAGCGTATGC-----
</pre>










<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 
   -->

The output is a sequence with no gaps.

<p>

An example is the ouput of the above input sequence:

<p>

<pre>
>dgshsh
ATGCGCAGGTACGTATGCTGACGGTACGTGATCGAGCTGACGAGCGTATGC
>hsf1
TGACTGATGCTGACTGACGTGACTGATGCTGATCGTGACTGATCGTGAC

<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
<p>
