Program primersearch
</H1>
<H2>
    Function
</H2>

<!--
DON'T WRITE ANYTHING HERE.
IT IS DONE FOR YOU.
-->
Searches DNA sequences for matches with primer pairs


<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.

        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will
        do what he wants. 

        Long description.

        Why it is useful.

        When it should/shouldn't be used.

        Algorithms

        Expanded description.

        eg: Reverse engineers Wheedle's 'talpsgob' program. This does a 
        splurge of the 5' end of the sequence followed by a durm.
        The net effect is a 5' end splurt.
        etc. for as long as is required (several pages is not unreasonable)
  -->

primersearch reads in primer pairs from an input file and searches
them against sequence(s) specified by the user. Each of the primers in
a pair is searched against the sequence and potential amplimers are
reported.
<p>

The user can specify a maximum percent mismatch level; for example,
10% mismatch on a primer of length 20bp means that the program will
classify a primer as matching a sequence if 18 of the 20 base pairs
matches.
<p>

It will only report matches if both primers in the pair have a match in
opposite orientations. 

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.
 -->


Here is a sample session with primersearch:

        This includes example input file formats.
        Except for sequences which can be described by 'sequence USA',
        this should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

The input primer file used in the example above has the following format:
<p>
<hr>
<pre>
# This is my primer file
D1S243  cacacaggctcacatgcc      gctccagcgtcatggact

D1S2660 cacacatgcacatgcac       agtgacaccagcaggg    
</pre>
<hr>
<p>

Comments can be inserted provided they are prefaced with "#"
<p>

Empty files will cause primersearch to note that no primers have 
been found, and to exit.
<p>

In this example, seqs.list contains the following sequences:
<p>

<hr>

        There are three columns separated by one or more space or TAB
	characters for X and Y values of durm, followed by energy

    Notes
</H2>

<!-- 
        Restrictions.
        Interesting behaviour.
        Useful things you can do with this program.
   -->

Every potential amplimer will be reported; if one primer matches the
forward strand twice and the other matches the reverse strand only
once, two potential amplimers are reported. If the reverse primer
matches twice, four potential amplimers are reported.
<p>

Each primer pair consists of a name, followed by two primer sequences,
primerA and primerB. The program first compares primerA to the forward
strand and if it matches, primerB is compared to the reverse
strand. The approach is then reversed, with the primerB being compared
to the forward strand and primerA to the reverse. In this way all
possible amplimers are reported.

<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

<!-- 
        Potentially stupid things the program will let you do.
        eg:
        It doesn't check to see if the sequence is a protein sequence or not.
   -->

This program is slow.
<br>
Don't try searching all of EMBL!
<br>
It might not be sensible to search all of the human section of EMBL - in 2000, this would take a day to do with one primer pair.
<br>
It will take longer with more primer pairs.
<br>
It will take longer if you allow mismatches.


<H2>
    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

<!-- 
        Error messages specific to this program.
        eg:

        "Threshold value greater than 1." - means that the threshold has
        been set to be greater than 1 but a burgle exception has
        occurred making this invalid - you should reduce the wobble
        parameter and try again. 

   --> 

"No suitable primers found - exiting" means that either the primers
file was empty or there were no compilable primer pairs contained in it.


<H2>
    Exit status
</H2>

<!-- 
        Description of the exit status for various error conditions
