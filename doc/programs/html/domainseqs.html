DOMAINSEQS parses a DCF file (domain classification file) and writes a file 
containing the same data, except that domain sequence 
information derived from structural and, optionally, sequence databases are
added.  
Domain sequences are taken from domain CCF files (clean coordinate files) 
and (optionally) the swissprot database.  

If the swissprot sequence is used, DOMAINSEQS requires a swissprot:PDB 
equivalence file that gives the accession number of each PDB file 
corresponding to the domains in the DCF file.  

The path for the CCF files (input) and names of DCF files (input and output) are specified by the user.  A log file is also written.






<!-- INPUT FILE FORMAT 
     Description and example(s) of input file formats.  Should provide enough
     information to write and parse the file.  Should describe the format in 
     unusual cases - null input, etc.

     Cannot use the test data files because they might be empty or need 
     hand-editing 

     Use "<b>DOMAINSEQS</b> reads any normal sequence USAs." if
     appropriate.

<!-- OUTPUT FILE FORMAT 
     Description and example(s) of output file formats.  Should provide enough
     information to write and parse the file.  Should describe the format in 
     unusual cases - null input, etc.  
     If the standard description of the avalable report formats is required, 
     use:   #include file="inc/reportformats.ihtml"
     Use "Outputs a graph to the specified graphics device."
     or  "outputs a report format file. The default format is ..."

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-dcfinfile]         infile     This option specifies the name of DCF file
                                  (domain classification file) (input). A
                                  'domain classification file' contains

                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain

                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
  [-dpdbdir]           directory  This option specifies the location of domain
                                  CCF file (clean coordinate files) (input).
                                  A 'clean cordinate file' contains coordinate
                                  and other data for a single PDB file or a

                                  (domains), contain 'cleaned-up' data that is
                                  self-consistent and error-corrected.
                                  Records for residue solvent accessibility
                                  and secondary structure are added to the

   -getswiss           toggle     Retrieve swissprot sequence.
*  -pdbtospfile        infile     This option specifies the name of the
                                  pdbcodes to swissprot indexing file. The
                                  swissprot:PDB equivalence file is generated
                                  by PDBTOSP
  [-dcfoutfile]        outfile    This option specifies the name of DCF file
                                  (domain classification file) (output). A
                                  'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by

                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
   -errfile            outfile    This option specifies the name of log file
                                  for the build. The log file contains
                                  messages about any errors arising while
                                  domainseqs ran.

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
*  -datafile           matrixf    This option specifies the residue
                                  substitution matrix, which is used for
                                  sequence comparison.
*  -gapopen            float      This option specifies the gap insertion
                                  penalty. This is the score taken away when a
                                  gap is created. The best value depends on
                                  the choice of comparison matrix. The default
                                  value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62
                                  matrix for protein sequences, and the
                                  EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide sequences.
*  -gapextend          float      This option specifies the gap extension
                                  penalty. This is added to the standard gap
                                  penalty for each base or residue in the gap.
                                  This is how long gaps are penalized.
                                  Usually you will expect a few long gaps
                                  rather than many short gaps, so the gap
                                  extension penalty should be lower than the
                                  gap penalty. An exception is where one or
                                  both sequences are single reads with
                                  possible sequencing errors in which case you
                                  would expect many single base gaps. You can
                                  get this result by setting the gap open
                                  penalty to zero (or very low) and using the
                                  gap extension penalty to control gap
                                  scoring.

<H3> 6.2 EXAMPLE SESSION </H3>
An example of interactive use of DOMAINSEQS is shown below.



<br><br>
The DCF file (domain classification file) lacking sequence information called 
/test_data/all.scop was parsed and a DCF file with sequence
information called /test_data/domainseqs/all_s.scop was written.  The file 
Epdbtosp.dat was queried for accession numbers of PDB files corresponding 
to the domains in all.scop, but no accession numbers were found for either 
of the domains d1ii7a_ or d1cs4a_.  A log file called 
/test_data/domainseqs/domainseqs.log was written.

<br><br><br><H2> 7.0   KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS     </H2>

The swissprot:PDB equivalence file available as part of the EMBOSS

<br><br><br><H2> 8.0   NOTES                     </H2>


DOMAINSEQS will not attempt to retrieve a swissprot sequence for any domains 
comprised of more than a single segment, i.e. for domains whose NC record 
in the DCF file has a value other than 1 
(see <a href="scopparse.html">SCOPPARSE documentation</a>).
<br>
The region of sequence to retrieve is identified by alignment of the sequence from the
CCF file (structural database) to the full length sequences in swissprot.   If this were to be done
for segmented domains, the start and end point for the retrieved sequence 
(relative to the full length sequence) might actually include a completely 
different domain.
<br><br>
Consider :
<br> (A) represents a sequence from the coordinate file for a segmented domain D1
<br> (B) represents the full-length swissprot sequence, it includes D1, but D1 is
 split by a second domain D2
<pre> 
                 D1
  (A)  XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  
          D1         D2        D1
  (B) XXXXXXXXXX-----------XXXXXXXXXXX
</pre>
  
 It should be clear that for an alignment retrieving B, the start and end 
 points for the retrieved sequence would be misleading.

<br><br>
The user should be aware that sequences from the domain CCF file
for domains comprised of more than a single segment are not biologically 
significant, as the sequences are derived from different segments of one or
more chains.  However, such sequences might be acceptable for redundancy 
calculations (e.g. by using <a href="domainnr.html">DOMAINNR</a>) because 
two redundant domains made of similar fragments will have similar sequences, 
so the redundancy should be detectable.

     A complete, non-technical, user-level description of the application.
-->
<a name="9.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 9.0   DESCRIPTION               </H2>

Domain sequences are not given in the raw SCOP or CATH parsable files, but are
required for many analyses and for convenience should, ideally, be provided
along with the classification itself.  DOMAINSEQS reads a DCF file (domain 
classificaiton file) that lacks sequence information and writes one 
containing sequence information.





<!-- ALGORITHM
     A technical description of algorithmic aspects, describing exactly how
     the key aspects of the application work.
-->
<a name="10.0"></a>
<br><br><br><H2> 10.0  ALGORITHM                 </H2>

In order to find the start and end of a domain in a sequence from swissprot, 
the domain sequence from the domain CCF file is aligned to the 
full length protein sequence from swissprot.  Alignment is performed first
by string handling and if that fails, by using the EMBOSS implementation of
the Needleman and Wunsch global alignment algorithm.  Gap insertion and 
extension penalties used in the alignments are user-specified.
