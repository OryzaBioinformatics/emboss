Nucleic acid pattern search


<H2>
    Description
</H2>


fuzznuc uses PROSITE style patterns to search nucleotide sequences. 

<p>
Patterns are specifications of a (typically short) length of sequence to
be found.  They can specify a search for an exact sequence or they can
allow various ambiguities, matches to variable lengths of sequence and
repeated subsections of the sequence. 

<p>
fuzznuc intelligently selects the optimum searching algorithm to use,
depending on the complexity of the search pattern specified. 

<H2>
    Usage
</H2>


Here is a sample session with fuzznuc.

<pre>

% fuzznuc
Input sequence: embl:hhtetra
Search pattern: AAGCTT
Number of mismatches [0]: 
Output file [hhtetra.fuzznuc]:

</pre>

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>


Patterns for fuzznuc are based on the format of pattern used in the
PROSITE database, with the difference that the terminating dot '.' and
the hyphens, '-', between the characters are optional. 

<p>
The PROSITE pattern definition from the PROSITE documentation (amended
to refer to nucleic acid sequences, not proteins) follows. 

<ul>

<li>The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the nucleotides are used. 

<li>The symbol `n' is used for a position where any nucleotide is
accepted. 

<li>Ambiguities are indicated by listing the acceptable nucleotides for a
given position, between square parentheses `[ ]'.  For example: [ACG]
stands for A or C or G. 

<li>Ambiguities are also indicated by listing between a pair of curly
brackets `{ }' the nucleotides that are not accepted at a given
position.  For example: {AG} stands for any nucleotides except A and G. 

<li>Each element in a pattern is separated from its neighbor by a `-'. 
(Optional in fuzznuc). 

<li>Repetition of an element of the pattern can be indicated by following
that element with a numerical value or a numerical range between
parenthesis.  Examples: N(3) corresponds to N-N-N, N(2,4) corresponds to
N-N or N-N-N or N-N-N-N. 

<li>When a pattern is restricted to either the 5' or 3' end of a
sequence, that pattern either starts with a `&lt;' symbol or respectively
ends with a `&gt;' symbol. 

<li>A period ends the pattern.  (Optional in fuzznuc). 

</ul>

<p>
For example, in the EMBL entry ECLAC you can look for the pattern:

<pre>

[CG](5)TG{A}N(1,5)C

</pre>

<p>
This searches for "C or G" 5 times, followed by T and G, then anything
except A, then any base (1 to 5 times) before a C. 

<p>
You can use ambiguity codes for nucleic acid searches but not within []
or {} as they expand to bracketed counterparts.  For example, "s" is
expanded to "[GC]" therefore [S] would be expanded to [[GC]] which is
illegal. 

<p>
Note the use of X is reserved for proteins.  You must use N for nucleic
acids to refer to any base. 

<p>
The search is case-independent, so 'AAA' matches 'aaa'. 

<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>


Here is the output from the example search:

<p>
<pre>

        HHTETRA     1 AAGCTT
        HHTETRA  1267 AAGCTT

</pre>

<p>
It is composed of three columns of data.

<ul>
<li>The first column is the name of the sequence being searched.
<li>The second is the start position of the match found.
<li>The third is the actual sequence that was matched by the search pattern. 
</ul>

If the option '-mmshow' is used, then an extra column of data is output
indicating how many mismatches there are in the match, for example:


<p>

<pre>
% fuzznuc embl:hhtetra -mmshow
Nucleic acid pattern search
Search pattern: AAGCTT
Number of mismatches [0]: 1
Output file [hhtetra.fuzznuc]: stdout
</pre>

<p>

<pre>

        HHTETRA       53     1 AAGCTG
        HHTETRA      140     1 AAGCAT
        HHTETRA      314     1 AACCTT
        HHTETRA      350     1 AAGCCT
        HHTETRA      374     1 AAGTTT
        HHTETRA     1009     1 AAGTTT
        HHTETRA     1259     1 AAGTTT
        HHTETRA     1267     0 AAGCTT

</pre>

<p>

If the option '-desc' is used then the description of the sequence is
displayed before each line showing the match details.  For example:

<p>

<pre>
% fuzznuc embl:hhtetra -desc
Nucleic acid pattern search
Search pattern: AAGCTT
Number of mismatches [0]: 
Output file [hhtetra.fuzznuc]: stdout


Human herpesvirus 7 (clone ED132'1.2) telomeric repeat region.
        HHTETRA        1 AAGCTT
Human herpesvirus 7 (clone ED132'1.2) telomeric repeat region.
        HHTETRA     1267 AAGCTT
</pre>

<p>

If the option '-acc' is also used then the accession number of the sequence is
displayed before each line showing the match details.  For example:

<p>

<pre>
% fuzznuc embl:hhtetra -desc -acc
Nucleic acid pattern search
Search pattern: AAGCTT
Number of mismatches [0]: 
Output file [hhtetra.fuzznuc]: stdout


L46634 Human herpesvirus 7 (clone ED132'1.2) telomeric repeat region.
        HHTETRA        1 AAGCTT
L46634 Human herpesvirus 7 (clone ED132'1.2) telomeric repeat region.
        HHTETRA     1267 AAGCTT
</pre>

<p>

If the option '-usa' is used then the Uniform Sequence Address is output
at the start of each line of match details.  For example:

<p>

<pre>
% fuzznuc embl:hhtetra -usa
Nucleic acid pattern search
Search pattern: AAGCTT
Number of mismatches [0]: 
Output file [hhtetra.fuzznuc]: stdout


embl-id:HHTETRA         HHTETRA        1 AAGCTT
embl-id:HHTETRA         HHTETRA     1267 AAGCTT
</pre>

<p>

This is useful because it turns the output into a 'list' file of
sequence names that can then be read in by other EMBOSS programs when a
'@' is put at the start of the file. 

<p>

If the option '-comp' is used, then the search will also be done on the
reverse sense strand.  Any matches in that strand will be displayed with
the start position using the forward-sense positions (it actually gives
the position of the end of the match).  The matching sequence will be
given in square brackets to distinguish this from a forward-sense match. 
For example:

<p>

<pre>
% fuzznuc embl:hhtetra -comp
Nucleic acid pattern search
Search pattern: AAGCTT
Number of mismatches [0]: 
Output file [hhtetra.fuzznuc]: stdout


        HHTETRA        1 AAGCTT
        HHTETRA     1267 AAGCTT
        HHTETRA        1 [AAGCTT]
        HHTETRA     1267 [AAGCTT]
</pre>

patterns but may be less easy for the user who has never used regular
expressions before:
