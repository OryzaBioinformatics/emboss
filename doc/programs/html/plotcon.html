<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.
        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will do what he wants. 
        Long description.
        Why it is useful.
        When it should/shouldn't be used.
        Algorithms
  -->

Displays a graphical representation of the similarity along a set of aligned sequences.
<p>

The similarity is calculated by moving a window of a specified length
along the aligned sequences.  Within the window, the similarity of any
one position is taken to be the average of all the possible pairwise
scores of the bases or residues at that position.  The pairwise scores
are taken from the specified similarity matrix.  The average of the
position similarities within the window is plotted. 
<p>

The program may be useful is determining where the quality of alignments
are good or bad. 



<H2>
    Usage
</H2>

<!--  
	Example usage, as run from the command-line.
        Many examples illustrating different behaviours is good.
 -->


Here is a sample session with <b>plotcon</b>:

<pre>

% plotcon -sformat msf alignment.msf

A set of gapped, aligned sequences.

A graph of the quality of the alignment is plotted.

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data

It reads in the specified similarity matrix.
<p>


<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>

<!-- 
        Potentially stupid things the program will let you do.
   -->

If you give it a set of unaligned sequences, it will plot the (poor!)
quality of these as if they were aligned.
