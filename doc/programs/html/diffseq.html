    Function

<!--

Find differences (SNPs) between nearly identical sequences


<H2>
    Description
</H2>

<!-- 
	This is the main part of the document.

        This is what the user looks at to find out if this program will
        do what he wants. 

        Long description.

        Why it is useful.

        When it should/shouldn't be used.

        Algorithms

        Expanded description.

        eg: Reverse engineers Wheedle's 'talpsgob' program. This does a 
        splurge of the 5' end of the sequence followed by a durm.
        The net effect is a 5' end splurt.
        etc. for as long as is required (several pages is not unreasonable)
  -->

   <b>diffseq</b> takes two overlapping, nearly identical sequences and reports the
   differences between them, together with any features that overlap with these
   regions. GFF files of the differences in each sequence are also produced.
<p>
   <b>diffseq</b> should be of value when looking for SNPs, differences between
   strains of an organism and anything else that requires the differences between
   sequences to be highlighted.
<p>  
   The sequences can be very long. The program does a match of all
   sequence words of size 10 (by default). It then reduces this to the
   minimum set of overlapping matches by sorting the matches in order of
   size (largest size first) and then for each such match it removes any
   smaller matches that overlap. The result is a set of the longest
   ungapped alignments between the two sequences that do not overlap with
   each other. The mismatched regions between these matches are reported.
<p>   
   It should be possible to find differences between sequences that are Mega bytes
   long.
<p>

    Usage

        Except for sequences which can be described by 'sequence USA',

        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what

   -->

A report of the differences between the two sequences is produced,
together with any features that overlap with these differing regions. 
<p>

<p>

The output is a standard EMBOSS report file. 

<p>

The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
command-line qualifier <b>-rformat xxx</b>, where 'xxx' is replaced by
the name of the required format.  The available format names are: embl,
genbank, gff, pir, swiss, trace, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq, excel,
feattable, motif, regions, seqtable, simple, srs, table, tagseq

<p>

The first line is the title giving the names of the sequences used.
<p>
The next two non-blank lines state the positions in each sequence where the detected
overlap between them starts.
<p>
There then follows a set of reports of the mismatches between the sequences.
<br>
Each report consists of 4 or more lines.
<br>
<ul>
<li>The first line has the name of the first sequence followed by the start and end
positions of the mismatched region in that sequence, followed by the length of
the mismatched region. If the mismatched region is of zero length in this sequence,
then only the position of the last matching base before the mismatch is given.</li>

<li>If a feature of the first sequence overlaps with this mismatch region, then one or more
lines starting with 'Feature:' comes next with the type, position and tag field
of the feature.</li>

<li>Next is a line starting "Sequence:" giving the sequence of the mismatch in the
first sequence.</li>
</ul>
<p>

This is followed by the equivalent information for the second sequence,
but in the reverse order, namely 'Sequence:' line, 'Feature:' lines and line
giving the position of the mismatch in the second sequence.
<p>

At the end of the report are two non-blank lines giving the positions in each
sequence where the detected
overlap between them ends.
<p>

The last three lines of the report gives the counts of SNPs (defined as a change of one nucleotide to
one other nucleotide, no deletions or insertions are counted, no multi-base changes are counted).
<p>

The counts of transitions (Pyrimide to Pyrimidine or Purine to Purine) and transversions (Pyrimidine to
Purine) are also given.
<p>

It should be noted that not all features are reported.
<p>

The 'source' feature found in all EMBL/Genbank feature table entries is not reported
as this covers all of the sequence and so overlaps with any difference found in that
sequence and so is uninformative and irritating. It has therefore been removed from
the output report.
<p>

The translation information of CDS features is often extremely long and does not add useful
information to the report. It has therefore been removed from the output report.
<p>

If no regions of alignment are found, the following output is given:

    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.

        eg:
        data file format:

	blank lines and comment lines are ignored.
        comment lines start with '#'
        There are three columns separated by one or more space or TAB
	characters for X and Y values of durm, followed by energy
        all coefficients are given as floating point values
        An example is:

        # Durm coefficient enery file
        # X     Y       Energy
        0.1     0.2     0.331
        0.2     0.4     0.332
        0.3     0.6     0.333
        0.3     0.8     0.334



If you wish to include the standard description of what data files
are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve them, use:

<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>

    Notes
</H2>

<!-- 
        Restrictions.
        Interesting behaviour.
        Useful things you can do with this program.
   -->

It should be noted that not all features are reported.

<p>

The 'source' feature found in all EMBL/Genbank feature table entries is
not reported as this covers all of the sequence and so overlaps with any
difference found in that sequence and so is uninformative and
irritating.  It has therefore been removed from the output report. 

<p>

The translation information of CDS features is often extremely long and
does not add useful information to the report.  It has therefore been
removed from the output report. 

<p>

If you run out of memory, use a larger word size.

<p>

Using a larger word size increases the length between mismatches that
will be reported as one event.  Thus a word size of 50 will report two
SNP that are with 50 bases of each other as one mismatch.
