<b>listor</b> reads in two sets of sequences and writes out a list file
(file of file names) that result from the logical union of these two
sets of sequences.  It is a simple way of manipulating and editing lists
or sets of sequences to produce a list file.

<p>

When comparing sequences to see if they are the same between two sets of
sequences, no use is made of the ID name or accession number of the
sequences.  Only the sequences themselves are compared.  The comparison
of the sequences is case-independent. 

<p>


The logical union is an OR operation by default.  Other available
operations are: AND, XOR and NOT. 

<p>

The (default) logical OR of the two sets of sequences is simply the
result of merging the two sets of sequences, (without listing any
shared sequences twice). 

<p>

A logical AND simply lists those sequences that occur in both sets of
sequences. 

<p>

A logical XOR lists those sequences that ONLY occur in the first set or
only occur in the second set - sequences occuring in both sets are
ignored (the opposite of an AND). 

<p>

A logical NOT lists all those sequences in the first set except for
those that also occur in the second set. 

<p>

An example of the four types of logical operation performed with the two
sets of sequences comprising these sequences follows.  The two sets of
sequences are in the files named <b>file1</b> and <b>file2</b>.  There
are 2 sequences which are duplicated between these two files ('two' and
'three') and the sequences 'one' and 'four' are unique to the files
'file1' and 'file2' respectively. 

<p>

<h3>file1</h3>
<pre>
>one
tagctagcg
>two
tagctagcggctacgt
>three
tagctattttatgctacgtcagtgac
</pre>

<p>


<h3>file2</h3>
<pre>
>two
tagctagcggctacgt
>three
tagctattttatgctacgtcagtgac
>four
gcgcggcgcgcgtgcgtcgttgctggggccc
</pre>

<p>

The results of the four types of logical union follows.  Note that the
duplicated sequences in these two files have been given the same name. 
This is not necessary for the operation of <b>listor</b> as it compares
the sequences themselves, not the ID names of the sequences. 

<p>

<h3>OR gives:</h3>
<pre>
fasta::file1:one
fasta::file1:two
fasta::file1:three
fasta::file2:four
</pre>

<p>

<h3>AND gives:</h3>
<pre>
fasta::file1:two
fasta::file1:three
</pre>


<h3>XOR gives:</h3>
<pre>
fasta::file1:one
fasta::file2:four
</pre>

<p>

<h3>NOT gives:</h3>
<pre>
fasta::file1:one
</pre>

<H2>
    Input file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example input file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null input, etc. 
   -->

The input sets of sequences can be of any valid USAs.  The program was
written to perform logical operations on list files, but in practice,
wildcarded database entries and file names are also perfectly legal
specifications of the input sequences. 













<H2>
    Output file format
</H2>

<!-- 
        This includes example output file formats.
        This should be a detailed description and example - assume
        someone will want to parse this file and will want to know what
        happens in unusual cases - null output, errors etc. 
   -->

The ouput is simply a list of the USAs (format and sequence
specification) resulting from the required logical union of the two sets
of input sequence. 

<p>

The order that the USAs are written out is not necessarily the same as
the order of either of the input sets of sequences. 



<H2>
    Data files
</H2>

<!-- 
        Any data files used (e.g. translation table file)
        This includes example data file formats if they are
        not obvious.
	If you wish to include the standard description of what data
	files are and how to use embossdata to inspect and retrieve
	them, use:
<p>
EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored
in the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined
by the EMBOSS environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

<p>

To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
<p>
<pre>
% embossdata -showall
</pre>
<p>
To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

<pre>

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

</pre>
<p>

Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called
".embossdata". Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home
directory, or again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

<p>
The directories are searched in the following order:

<ul>
   <li> . (your current directory)
   <li> .embossdata (under your current directory)
   <li> ~/ (your home directory)
   <li> ~/.embossdata
</ul>
<p>

   -->

None.













<H2>
    Notes
</H2>

<!-- 
        Restrictions.
        Interesting behaviour.
        Useful things you can do with this program.
   -->

The program stores all of the input sequences in memory while it is
working out the logical unions of the two sets of sequences.  This means
that it is restricted by the available memory.  Doing logical unions
involving all of the sequences in large databases, such as EMBL, is
probably impractical unless you are lucky enough to have extraordinary
amounts of memory on your machine. 






<H2>
    References
</H2>

<!-- 
        Bibliography for methods used.
   -->

None.








<H2>
    Warnings
</H2>

<!-- 
        Potentially stupid things the program will let you do.
   -->

If you try to do a logical union with all of the sequences in EMBL and
another sequence set, this program will attempt to read all of the EMBL
sequences into memory at once. This will probably not succeed.







<H2>
    Diagnostic Error Messages
</H2>

<!-- 
        Error messages specific to this program, eg:
        "FATAL xxx" - means you have not set up the xxx data using program <b>prog</b>.<p>

It always exits with status 0.
