<table CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=3 BGCOLOR="#f5f5ff" ><tr><td>
<pre>
   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-seqpairsdir]       dirlist    Input directory of files containing sequence
                                  pairs for alignment
  [-pathtocommands]    directory  Directory where alignment executables live
  [-firstcommandname]  string     Name of first alignment executable
  [-secondcommandname] string     Name of second alignment executable
  [-scoringmatrixdirname] directory  Directory where scoring matrix lives
  [-scoringmatrixname] string     Name of scoring matrix
   -gapopen            float      The gap opening penalty is subtracted from
                                  the total score every time a gap is inserted
                                  in the alignment. The default value is
                                  chosen for the EBLOSUM62 scoring matrix when
                                  you are aligning protein sequences, and the
                                  EDNAFULL matrix when you are aligning
                                  nucleotide sequences. If you sequence
                                  contains many small errors you should set a
                                  low gap opening penalty (near zero) to avoid
                                  over-penalizing those errors.
   -gapextend          float      The gap extension penalty is the score
                                  substracted when more spaces are added to an
                                  existing alignment gap. Often a single
                                  insertion or deletion affects multiple
                                  residues/nucleotides; separate opening and
                                  extension penalties reduce the excessive
                                  penalty such events would otherwise carry;
                                  generally the gap extension penalty should
                                  be significantly lower than the gap opening
                                  penalty.
   -[no]zeroend        boolean    If this option is true then no penalty is
                                  added for gaps at either ends of a trace.
  [-firstalignedseqsoutdir] outdir     Name of directory containing sequences
                                  aligned by first method
  [-secondalignedseqsoutdir] outdir     Name of directory containing sequences
                                  aligned by second method
  [-firstoutfilesuffix] string     Appended to end of all output file names of
                                  sequences aligned by first alignment method
  [-secondoutfilesuffix] string     Appended to end of all output file names of
                                  sequences aligned by second alignment method
  [-outfileformat]     string     Format of output alignments for both methods

   -filter             boolean    Read standard input, write standard output
   -options            boolean    Prompt for standard and additional values
   -debug              boolean    Write debug output to program.dbg
   -verbose            boolean    Report some/full command line options
