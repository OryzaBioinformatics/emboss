                                Program abiview
                                       
Function

   Reads ABI file and display the trace
   
Description

   abiview reads in an ABI sequence trace file and graphically displays
   the results.
   
   The data for each nucleotide is plotted and the assigned nucleotide
   (G, A, T, C or N) in the ABI file is overlayed on the graphs.
   
   It also writes out the sequence to an output sequence file.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with abiview:

% abiview
Name of the ABI trace file: ba16d2.s1
Output sequence [outfile.fasta]:
Graph type [x11]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-fname]             string     Name of the ABI trace file
  [-outseq]            seqout     Sequence file
   -graph              xygraph    Graph type

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -separate           bool       Separate the trace graphs for the 4 bases
   -yticks             bool       Display y-axis ticks
   -window             integer    Sequence display window size
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-fname]
   (Parameter 1) Name of the ABI trace file Any string is accepted An
   empty string is accepted
   [-outseq]
   (Parameter 2) Sequence file Writeable sequence <sequence>.format
   -graph Graph type EMBOSS has a list of known devices, including
   postscript, ps, hpgl, hp7470, hp7580, meta, colourps, cps, xwindows,
   x11, tektronics, tekt, tek4107t, tek, none, null, text, data, xterm
   EMBOSS_GRAPHICS value, or x11
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -separate Separate the trace graphs for the 4 bases Yes/No No
   -yticks Display y-axis ticks Yes/No No
   -window Sequence display window size Any integer value 40
   
Input file format

   This reads in a standard ABI trace file.
   
Output file format

   It outputs a file holding a normal nucleotide sequence.
   
   It outputs a graphical image of the traces.
   The graphical output from the above example is here.
   
   The horizontal scale of the output image labelled 'Residue Position'
   is only a very approximate indication of the spacing of residues in
   the image. The real residue spacing is variable, as it relies on the
   speed with which the oligo-nucleotides are eluted in the ABI
   sequencer. Do not be surprised to see the nucleotide signals spaced at
   a much greater distance than the horizontal scale might suggest.
