1.0 SUMMARY

   Add secondary structure records to a DCF file

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   DOMAINSSE parses a DCF file (domain classification file) and writes a
   file containing the same data, except that domain secondary structure
   information derived from structural are added. Domain sequences are
   taken from domain CCF files (clean coordinate files). The CCF files
   must contain secondary structure information, which can be added by
   using PDBPLUS. The path for the CCF files (input) and names of DCF
   files (input and output) are specified by the user. The extension of
   CCF files is specified in the ACD file. A log file is also written.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the DCF file is described in the SCOPPARSE
   documentation. An example of the input file is shown in Figure 1.

4.0 OUTPUT FILE FORMAT

   The format of the DCF file is described in the SCOPPARSE
   documentation. DOMAINRESO adds the following records:
     * (1) SS - Secondary structure assignment (per residue). A
       simplified 3-state assignment: H (helix), E (extended, beta
       strand) and L (loop, open coil) is used.
     * (2) SE - Secondary structure element assignment (per secondary
       structure element). The same 3-state assignment as for the SS
       record is used: H (helix), E (extended, beta strand) and L (loop,
       open coil).

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   Domain secondary structure information is not given in the raw SCOP or
   CATH parsable files, but is required for many analyses and for
   convenience should, ideally, be provided along with the classification
   itself. DOMAINSSE reads a DCF file (domain classificaiton file) that
   lacks secondary structure information and writes one containing such
   information.
