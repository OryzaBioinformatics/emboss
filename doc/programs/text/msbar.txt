Function

   Mutate sequence beyond all recognition
   
Description

   This program changes a sequence a lot or a little, attempting to
   emulate various forms of mutation. You can set the number and types of
   mutations.
   
   It can act on the following sizes of sequence:
     * Point (single base or residue change)
     * Codon (not applicable in proteins)
     * Block of sequence (of a specified minimum and maximum random size)
       
   If the sequence is nucleic, the codon and block-sized operations can
   optionally be done in-frame. This causes the minimum block size to be
   set to 3 and the randomly chosen positions to be multiples of 3.
   
   For each of the above size of sequence it can produce the effects of
   any of the following types of mutation at a randomly chosen position:
     * Insertion of a randomly generated sequence
     * Deletion
     * Change (deletion then insertion of a random sequence of the same
       size)
     * Duplication at an adjacent position
     * Move region from one position to another (without deletion of the
       original)
     * Any of the above, chosen at random.
     * None of the above
       
   The input and output sequences may not differ if only a few changes
   are chosen as (for example) one in four nucleic acid point
   substitutions will not change the sequence.
   
   N.B. There is no selection of the types of mutation to produce viable
   sequence as there would be in a real organism. In particular, there is
   no attempt to bias mutations of nucleic acid sequences to conform to
   the C+G ratio in the sequence or to bias the codons in the direction
   of the frequencies used in the organism. This program emulates
   mutation, not selection.
   
   This program was named from the acronym of "Mutate Sequence Beyond All
   Recognition", by analogy with the acronym "fubar" commonly used in the
   US and UK armies.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with msbar. This asks for 5 mutations, with
   point mutations as changes (substitutions), and the codon and block
   mutations ignored.
