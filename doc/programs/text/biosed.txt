Function

   Replace or delete sequence sections
   
Description

   biosed is a simple sequence editing utility that searches for a target
   subsequence in one or more input sequences and replaces it with a
   specified second subsequence (or optionally just deletes the found
   target subsequence).
   
   biosed was inspired by the useful UNIX utility sed which searches for
   a pattern in text and can replace or delete the found pattern.
   
   If the target subsequence occurs more than once, then each instance of
   the target is replaced.
   
   The target subsequence is not any sort of an ambiguity pattern, it is
   just a short sequence. A simple string match is done and if it exactly
   matches then the replacement is done. The matching is independent of
   the case of the sequence or the target - both uppercase and lowercase
   will match.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with biosed:
   
   Replace all 'T's with 'U's to create a RNA sequence
   
% biosed em:hsfau hsfau.rna -target T -replace U

   Replace all 'RGD' protein motifs with 'XXRGDXX'
   
% biosed sw:A4M1_HUMAN A4M1_HUMAN.pep -target RGD -replace XXRGDXX

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
   -target             string     Sequence section to match
*  -replace            string     Replacement sequence section
  [-outseq]            seqout     Output sequence USA

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -delete             boolean    Delete the target sequence sections

   General qualifiers:
  -help                boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   -target Sequence section to match Any string is accepted N
   -replace Replacement sequence section Any string is accepted A
   [-outseq]
   (Parameter 2) Output sequence USA Writeable sequence <sequence>.format
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -delete Delete the target sequence sections Yes/No No
   
Input file format

   It reads the USA of one or more nucleic acid or protein sequences.
   
Output file format

   The edited sequence is output.
   
   The sequence will be in uppercase.
   
Data files

   None.
   
Notes

   The edited sequence will be output in uppercase.
   
References

   None.
   
Warnings

   No check is made on the replacement subsequence.
   Any text can be used as the replacement, including characters only
   used in proteins (e.g. D, E, F, etc.), characters not used in proteins
   (e.g. J, O, etc), digits and punctuation characters.
   
Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.
   
Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.
   
Known bugs

   None.
