                                Program ajtest
                                       
Function

   Test file for ACD parsing
   
Description

   If you are not interested in developing EMBOSS programs yourself, then
   you should stop reading now.
   Read no further.
   
   ajtest is of no use to you.
   
   ajtest is simply the name given to a generic test program that is used
   to evaluate the behaviour of various EMBOSS functions during the
   writing of other programs. The contents of this program will change
   depending on whatever programs were last being developed when this
   EMBOSS release was made public.
   
   ajtest serves no purpose that is useful for the general user
   community. It is only useful as a general-purpose program to serve as
   a test-bed for developers.
   
   It is here simply as a useful generic application for people creating
   new library functions that they wish to call in the context of a real
   EMBOSS program.
