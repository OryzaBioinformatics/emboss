Function

   Get ontology term(s) original full text

Description

   ontotext reads one or more complete ontology term entries from a
   database or a file and writes them to a text file. Optionally, the
   first ontology term from the input stream only can be retrieved. The
   complete entry, including heading annotation, is retrieved and written
   and the data is not altered or reformatted in any way.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with ontotext


% ontotext edam:1234
Get ontology term(s) original full text
Full text output file [1234.ontotext]:


   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 2


% ontotext edam:0850 -subclasses
Get ontology term(s) original full text
Full text output file [0850.ontotext]:


   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-oboterms]          obo        Obo term filename and optional format, or

   -obsolete           boolean    [N] The default behaviour is to not use or
                                  return obsolete terms. This option if set
                                  will include all terms.

Input file format

   The input is a standard EMBOSS ontology query.

   The major ontology sources defined as standard in EMBOSS installations
   are EDAM, GO (gene Ontology) and SO (Sequence Ontology).

   Data can also be read from ontology output in "obo" format written by
   an EMBOSS application.
