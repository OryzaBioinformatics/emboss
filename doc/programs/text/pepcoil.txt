Function

   Predicts coiled coil regions
   
Description

   Coiled coils are formed by two or three alpha helices in parallel and
   in register that cross at an angle of approximately 20 degrees, are
   strongly amphipathic and display a pattern of hydrophilic and
   hydrophobic residues that is repeated every seven residues. The seven
   positions of the heptad repeat are designated a through g, a and d
   being generally hydrophobic, while the others are hydrophilic.
   
   The parallel two-stranded alpha-helical coiled coil is the most
   frequently encountered subunit-oligomerization motif in proteins.
   
   pepcoil calculates the probability of a coiled-coil structure for
   windows of 28 residues through a protein sequence using the method of

Input file format

Output file format

   Here is the output file from the example run. The SwissProt annotation
   marks the true leucine zipper motif as from 253 to 274. The leucine
   zipper is a special case of a coiled-coil region.
