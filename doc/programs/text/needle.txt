Function

   Needleman-Wunsch global alignment
   
Description

   This program uses the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm to
   find the optimum alignment (including gaps) of two sequences when
   considering their entire length.
   
   The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a member of the class of algorithms
   that can calculate the best score and alignment in the order of mn
   steps, (where 'n' and 'm' are the lengths of the two sequences). These
   dynamic programming algorithms were first developed for protein
   sequence comparison by Needleman and Wunsch, though similar methods
   were independently devised during the late 1960's and early 1970's for
   use in the fields of speech processing and computer science.
   
   What is the optimal alignment? Dynamic programming methods ensure the
   optimal global alignment by exploring all possible alignments and
   choosing the best. It does this by reading in a scoring matrix that
   contains values for every possible residue or nucleotide match. Needle
   finds an alignment with the maximum possible score where the score of
   an alignment is equal to the sum of the matches taken from the scoring
   matrix.
   
   An important problem is the treatment of gaps, i.e., spaces inserted
   to optimise the alignment score. A penalty is subtracted from the
   score for each gap opened (the 'gap open' penalty) and a penalty is
   subtracted from the score for the total number of gap spaces
   multiplied by a cost (the 'gap extension' penalty).
   
   Typically, the cost of extending a gap is set to be 5-10 times lower
   than the cost for opening a gap.

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequencea]         sequence   Sequence USA
  [-seqall]            seqall     Sequence database USA
   -gapopen            float      The gap open penalty is the score taken away
                                  when a gap is created. The best value
                                  depends on the choice of comparison matrix.
                                  The default value assumes you are using the
                                  EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein sequences, and
                                  the EDNAMAT matrix for nucleotide sequences.
   -gapextend          float      The gap extension, penalty is added to the
                                  standard gap penalty for each base or
                                  residue in the gap. This is how long gaps
                                  are penalized. Usually you will expect a few
                                  long gaps rather than many short gaps, so
                                  the gap extension penalty should be lower
                                  than the gap penalty. An exception is where
                                  one or both sequences are single reads with
                                  possible sequencing errors in which case you
                                  would expect many single base gaps. You can
                                  get this result by setting the gap open
                                  penalty to zero (or very low) and using the
                                  gap extension penalty to control gap
                                  scoring.

   [-sequencea]

   [-seqall]
   (Parameter 2) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   -gapopen The gap open penalty is the score taken away when a gap is
   created. The best value depends on the choice of comparison matrix.
   The default value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62 matrix for
   protein sequences, and the EDNAMAT matrix for nucleotide sequences.
   Floating point number from 1.0 to 100.0 10.0 for any sequence
   -gapextend The gap extension, penalty is added to the standard gap
   penalty for each base or residue in the gap. This is how long gaps are
   penalized. Usually you will expect a few long gaps rather than many
   short gaps, so the gap extension penalty should be lower than the gap
   penalty. An exception is where one or both sequences are single reads
   with possible sequencing errors in which case you would expect many
   single base gaps. You can get this result by setting the gap open
   penalty to zero (or very low) and using the gap extension penalty to
   control gap scoring. Floating point number from 0.0 to 10.0 0.5 for
   any sequence

Data files

   For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution matrix.
   For nucleotide sequence, EDNAMAT is used. Others can be specified.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
       
Notes

   needle is a true imple,entation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and
   so produces a full path matrix. It therefore cannot be used with
   genome sized sequences unless you've a lot of memory and a lot of
   time.

Warnings

   needle is for aligning two sequences over their entire length. This
   works best with closely related sequences. If you use needle to align
   very distantly-related sequences, it will produce a result but much of
   the alignment may have little or no biological significance.
   
   The memory and time required to do the search is proportional to (on
   the order of) mn, where 'n' and 'm' are the lengths of the two
   sequences. This means that aligning two 1000-residue sequences takes
   roughly 100 times longer and uses 100 times more memory than aligning
   two 100-residue sequences.

   stretcher Finds the best global alignment between two sequences
   
   When you want an alignment that covers the whole length of both
   sequences, use needle. 
   
   When you are trying to find the best region of similarity between two
   sequences, use water.
   
   stretcher is a more suitable program to use to find global alignments
   of very long sequences.
