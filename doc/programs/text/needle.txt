Function

   Needleman-Wunsch global alignment of two sequences

Description

   needle reads two input sequences and writes their optimal global
   sequence alignment to file. It uses the Needleman-Wunsch alignment
   algorithm to find the optimum alignment (including gaps) of two
   sequences along their entire length. The algorithm uses a dynamic
   programming method to ensure the alignment is optimum, by exploring all
   possible alignments and choosing the best. A scoring matrix is read
   that contains values for every possible residue or nucleotide match.
   Needle finds the alignment with the maximum possible score where the
   score of an alignment is equal to the sum of the matches taken from the
   scoring matrix, minus penalties arising from opening and extending gaps
   in the aligned sequences. The substitution matrix and gap opening and
   extension penalties are user-specified.

  Algorithm

   The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is a member of the class of algorithms
   that can calculate the best score and alignment of two sequences in the
   order of mn steps, where n and m are the sequence lengths. These
   dynamic programming algorithms were first developed for protein
   sequence comparison by Needleman and Wunsch, though similar methods
   were independently devised during the late 1960's and early 1970's for
   use in the fields of speech processing and computer science.

   An important problem is the treatment of gaps, i.e., spaces inserted to
   optimise the alignment score. A penalty is subtracted from the score
   for each gap opened (the 'gap open' penalty) and a penalty is
   subtracted from the score for the total number of gap spaces multiplied
   by a cost (the 'gap extension' penalty). Typically, the cost of
   extending a gap is set to be 5-10 times lower than the cost for opening
   a gap.

   Penalty for a gap of n positions is calculated using the following
   formula:
gap opening penalty + (n - 1) * gap extension penalty

   In a Needleman-Wunsch global alignment, the entire length of each
   sequence is aligned. The sequences might be partially overlapping or
   one sequence might be aligned entirely internally to the other. There
   is no penalty for the hanging ends of the overlap. In bioinformatics,
   it is usually reasonable to assume that the sequences are incomplete
   and there should be no penalty for failing to align the missing bases.

Needleman-Wunsch global alignment of two sequences
Version: EMBOSS:6.2.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-asequence]         sequence   Sequence filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input USA)
  [-bsequence]         seqall     Sequence(s) filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input USA)
   -gapopen            float      [10.0 for any sequence] The gap open penalty
                                  is the score taken away when a gap is
                                  created. The best value depends on the
                                  choice of comparison matrix. The default
                                  value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62
                                  matrix for protein sequences, and the
                                  EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide sequences.
                                  (Floating point number from 1.0 to 100.0)
   -gapextend          float      [0.5 for any sequence] The gap extension,
                                  penalty is added to the standard gap penalty
                                  for each base or residue in the gap. This
                                  is how long gaps are penalized. Usually you
                                  will expect a few long gaps rather than many
                                  short gaps, so the gap extension penalty
                                  should be lower than the gap penalty. An
                                  exception is where one or both sequences are
                                  single reads with possible sequencing
                                  errors in which case you would expect many
                                  single base gaps. You can get this result by
                                  setting the gap open penalty to zero (or
                                  very low) and using the gap extension
                                  penalty to control gap scoring. (Floating
                                  point number from 0.0 to 10.0)

                                  comparing sequences. By default it is the
                                  file 'EBLOSUM62' (for proteins) or the file
                                  'EDNAFULL' (for nucleic sequences). These
                                  files are found in the 'data' directory of
                                  the EMBOSS installation.
   -endweight          boolean    [N] Apply end gap penalties.
   -endopen            float      [10.0 for any sequence] The end gap open
                                  penalty is the score taken away when an end
                                  gap is created. The best value depends on
                                  the choice of comparison matrix. The default
                                  value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62
                                  matrix for protein sequences, and the

                                  extension, penalty is added to the end gap
                                  penalty for each base or residue in the end
                                  gap. This is how long end gaps are
                                  penalized. (Floating point number from 0.0

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS alignment file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -aformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. Some of the alignment formats can cope
   with an unlimited number of sequences, while others are only for pairs
   of sequences.

   The available multiple alignment format names are: unknown, multiple,
   simple, fasta, msf, trace, srs

   The available pairwise alignment format names are: pair, markx0,
   markx1, markx2, markx3, markx10, srspair, score

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/AlignFormats.html for further
   information on alignment formats.

   The Identity: is the percentage of identical matches between the two
   sequences over the reported aligned region (including any gaps in the
   length).

   The Similarity: is the percentage of matches between the two sequences
   over the reported aligned region (including any gaps in the length).

Data files

   For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution matrix.
   For nucleotide sequence, EDNAFULL is used. Others can be specified.

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat


   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata". Files
   for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or again
   in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

Notes

   needle is a true implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and
   so produces a full path matrix. It therefore cannot be used with genome
   sized sequences unless you've a lot of memory and a lot of time.

Warnings

   needle is for aligning two sequences over their entire length. This
   works best with closely related sequences. If you use needle to align
   very distantly-related sequences, it will produce a result but much of
   the alignment may have little or no biological significance.

   A true Needleman Wunsch implementation like needle needs memory
   proportional to the product of the sequence lengths. For two sequences
   of length 10,000,000 and 1,000 it therefore needs memory proportional
   to 10,000,000,000 characters. Two arrays of this size are produced, one
   of ints and one of floats so multiply that figure by 8 to get the
   memory usage in bytes. That doesn't include other overheads. Therefore
   only use water and needle for accurate alignment of reasonably short
   sequences.

   If you run out of memory, try using stretcher instead.

Diagnostic Error Messages

                    When you want an alignment that covers the whole length of both
                    sequences, use needle.

                    When you are trying to find the best region of similarity between two
                    sequences, use water.

                    stretcher is a more suitable program to use to find global alignments
                    of very long sequences.
