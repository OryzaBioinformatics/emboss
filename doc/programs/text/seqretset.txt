                               Program seqretset
                                       
Function

   Reads and writes (returns) a set of sequences all at once
   
Description

Usage

   Here is a sample session with seqretset.

% seqretset
Reads and writes (returns) a set of sequences all at once
Input sequence set: embl:eclac*
Output sequence [outfile.fasta]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqset     Sequence set USA
  [-outseq]            seqoutset  Output sequence set USA

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   
   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence set USA Readable sequences Required
   [-outseq]
   (Parameter 2) Output sequence set USA Writeable sequences
   <sequence>.format
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

Output file format

   The output from seqretset is a set of sequences, and by default will
   be written in FASTA format all in one file.
   
   In some cases the output filename will be the same as the input
   filename, but as seqretset reads all the sequences before opening the
   output file it will safely overwrite. Note that this is not true of
   seqretall which only reads the first sequence before opening the ouput
   file, but is true of seqret which reads the first sequence at startup.
