                              Program extractseq
                                       
Function

   Extract regions from a sequence
   
Description

   This allows you to specify one or more regions of a sequence to
   extract sub-sequences from to build up a contiguous resulting
   sequence.
   
   This is modelled on the cell's process of splicing out exons from
   mRNA, but the program is generally applicable to any cutting and
   splicing or editing operation on a single sequence.
   
Usage

   Extract the region from position 10 to 20.
% extractseq main.seq result.seq -regions '10-20'

   Extract the regions 10 to 20, 30 to 45, 533 to 537
% extractseq main.seq result2.seq -regions '10-20, 30-45, 533-537'

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
  [-outseq]            seqoutall  Output sequence(s) USA
   -regions            range      Regions to extract.
                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of
                                  pairs of positions.
                                  The positions are integers.
                                  They are separated by any non-digit,
                                  non-alpha character.
                                  Examples of region specifications are:
                                  24-45, 56-78
                                  1:45, 67=99;765..888
                                  1,5,8,10,23,45,57,99

   Optional qualifiers:
   -separate           bool       If this is set true then each specified
                                  region is written out as a separate
                                  sequence. The name of the sequence is
                                  created from the name of the original
                                  sequence with the start and end positions of
                                  the range appended with underscore
                                  characters between them, eg: XYZ region 2 to
                                  34 is written as: XYZ_2_34

   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   
   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default

   <sequence>.format
   -regions Regions to extract. A set of regions is specified by a set of
   pairs of positions. The positions are integers. They are separated by
   any non-digit, non-alpha character. Examples of region specifications
   are: 24-45, 56-78 1:45, 67=99;765..888 1,5,8,10,23,45,57,99 Sequence
   range Whole sequence
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -separate If this is set true then each specified region is written
   out as a separate sequence. The name of the sequence is created from
   the name of the original sequence with the start and end positions of
   the range appended with underscore characters between them, eg: XYZ
   region 2 to 34 is written as: XYZ_2_34 Yes/No No
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

   Normal sequence.
   
   You can specifiy a file of ranges to extract by giving the '-regions'
   qualifier the value '@' followed by the name of the file containing
   the ranges. (eg: '-regions @myfile').
   
   The format of the range file is:
     * Comment lines start with '#' in the first column.
     * Comment lines and blank lines are ignored.
     * The line may start with white-space.
     * There are two positive (integer) numbers per line separated by one
       or more space or TAB characters.
     * The second number must be greater or equal to the first number.
     * There can be optional text after the two numbers to annotate the
       line.
     * White-space before or after the text is removed.
       
   An example range file is:

# this is my set of ranges
12   23
 4   5       this is like 12-23, but smaller
67   10348   interesting region

Output file format

   The output is a normal sequence file.
   
   If the option '-separate' is used then each specified region is
   written to the output file as a separate sequence. The name of the
   sequence is created from the name of the original sequence with the
   start and end positions of the range appended with underscore
   characters between them,
   
   For example: "XYZ region 2 to 34" is written as: "XYZ_2_34"

Diagnostic Error Messages

   Several warning messages about malformed region specifications:
     * Non-digit found in region ...
     * Unpaired start of a region found in ...
     * Non-digit found in region ...
     * The start of a pair of region positions must be smaller than the
       end in ...
       
Exit status

   It exits with status 0, unless a region is badly constructed.
   
Known bugs

   None noted.
