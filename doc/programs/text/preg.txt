Function

   Regular expression search of a protein sequence
   
Description

   This searches for matches of a regular expression to a protein
   sequence.
   
   A regular expression is a way of specifying an ambiguous pattern to
   search for. Regular expressions are commonly used in some computer
   programming languages and may be more familiar to some users than to
   others.
   
   The following is a short guide to regular expressions in EMBOSS:
   
   ^
          use this at the start of a pattern to insist that the pattern
          can only match at the start of a sequence. (eg. '^M' matches a
          methionine at the start of the sequence)
          
   $
          use this at the end of a pattern to insist that the pattern can
          only match at the end of a sequence (eg. 'R$' matches an
          arginine at the end of the sequence)
          
   ()
          groups a pattern. This is commonly used with '|' (eg.
          '(ACD)|(VWY)' matches either the first 'ACD' or the second
          'VWY' pattern )
          
   |
          This is the OR operator to enable a match to be made to either
          one pattern OR another. There is no AND operator in this
          version of regular expressions.
          
   The following quantifier characters specify the number of time that
   the character before (in this case 'x') matches:
   
   x?
          matches 0 or 1 times (ie, '' or 'x')
          
   x*
          matches 0 or more times (ie, '' or 'x' or 'xx' or 'xxx', etc)
          
   x+
          matches 1 or more times (ie, 'x' or 'xx' or 'xxx', etc)
          
   Quantifiers can follow any of the following types of character
   specification:
   
   x
          any character (ie 'A')
          
   \x
          the character after the backslash is used instead of its normal
          regular expression meaning. This is commonly used to turn off
          the special meaning of the characters '^$()|?*+[]-.'. It may be
          especially useful when searching for gap characters in a
          sequence (eg '\.' matches only a dot character '.')
          
   [xy]
          match one of the characters 'x' or 'y'. You may have one or
          more characters in this set.
          
   [x-z]
          match any one of the set of characters starting with 'x' and
          ending in 'y' in ASCII order (eg '[A-G]' matches any one of:
          'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G')
          
   [^x-z]
          matches anything except any one of the group of characters in
          ASCII order (eg '[^A-G]' matches anything EXCEPT any one of:
          'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G')
          
   .
          the dot character matches any other character (eg: 'A.G'
          matches 'AAG', 'AaG', 'AZG', 'A-G' 'A G', etc.)
          
   Combining some of these features gives these examples from the PROSITE
   patterns database:
'[STAGCN][RKH][LIVMAFY]$'

   which is the 'Microbodies C-terminal targeting signal'.
'LP.TG[STGAVDE]'

   which is the 'Gram-positive cocci surface proteins anchoring
   hexapeptide'.
   
   Regular expressions are case-sensitive. The pattern 'AAAA' will not
   match the sequence 'aaaa'.
