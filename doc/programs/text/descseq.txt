Function

   Alter the name or description of a sequence

Description

   Most sequence formats allow, at the very minimum, a name for the
   sequence and some comments to be stored in the sequence file.

   Rather than using an editor to alter the name or the comments, descseq
   allows you to simply change them and write out a new file with the
   changes in and the sequence left unaltered.

   The default action is to replace the existing name or description with
   your new one, but by using the qualifier '-append' what you enter is
   appended to the existing name or description.

   Note that if you append to a description, no space is inserted by
   default bewteen the existing description and your appended text. You
   have to put in a space yourself if you require one.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with descseq

   Set the name of a sequence to "myclone23"


% descseq -seq dna.text -out clone23.seq -name "myclone23" 
Alter the name or description of a sequence.

   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 2

   Set the description of a sequence to "This is my clone number 244"


% descseq -seq dna.text -out xy24.seq -desc "This is my clone number 244" 
Alter the name or description of a sequence.

   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 3

   Append some text to the description of a sequence


% descseq -seq dna.text -out est4.seq -desc " (submitted)" -append 
Alter the name or description of a sequence.
