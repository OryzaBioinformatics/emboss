Function

   Alter the name or description of a sequence

Description

   descseq reads a sequence and writes it to file but with a different
   name and / or description. All other records including the sequence
   itself are left unaltered.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with descseq

   Set the name of a sequence to "myclone23"


% descseq -seq dna.text -out clone23.seq -name 'myclone23'
Alter the name or description of a sequence.


   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 2

   Set the description of a sequence to "This is my clone number 244"


% descseq -seq dna.text -out xy24.seq -desc 'This is my clone number 244'
Alter the name or description of a sequence.


   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 3

   Append some text to the description of a sequence


% descseq -seq dna.text -out est4.seq -desc ' (submitted)' -append
Alter the name or description of a sequence.


   Go to the output files for this example

Command line arguments

Input file format

   descseq reads a normal sequence USA.

  Input files for usage example

Notes

   Most sequence formats allow, at the very minimum, a name for the
   sequence and some comments to be stored in the sequence file. descseq
   let's you change the sequence name and / or description, and is far
   more convenient and less error-prone than using the editor for editing.

   The default action is to replace the existing name or description with
   your new one, but by using the qualifier -append what you enter is
   appended to the existing name or description. Note that if you append
   to a description, no space is inserted by default bewteen the existing
   description and your appended text. You have to put in a space yourself
   if you require one.
