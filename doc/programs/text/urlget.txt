Function

   Get URLs of data resources

Description

   Retrieves one or more URLs for further information about an identifier
   in a data resource.

   EMBOSS can retrieve specific data types (sequences, features, taxonomy,
   resources, ontology terms) as defined ACD types.

   Where there is no defined ACD inpu type, EMBOSS can retrieve the text
   of a database entry where the information is provided in a
   human-readable text format.

   For many data resources there is no retrievable data format. In these
   cases EMBOSS can use the Data Resource Catalogue to construct URLs that
   can be viewed in the user's preferred browser which should be able to
   render them in a meaningful way.

Algorithm

   urlget constructs the URL using the information in the Data Resource
   Catalogue entry which can be retrieved in its original format using
   drget.

   The Query records are searched to find a query that returns HTML data
   (not parseable as text). The user-supplied identifier is inserted in
   the query to construct a URL.

   If the identifier is specified as a swissprot (-swiss) or EMBL (-embl)
   cross-reference the defiitions of swissprot or EMBL cross-references in
   the DRCAT entry are used to select queries matching the identifier
   type.

   Alternatively, the EDAM term name describing the identifier can be
   provided by the user to resolve the selection from multiple queries.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with urlget


% urlget pseudocap:PA3363 -swiss

Input file format

   urlget reads a query containing a database name from DRCAT and an
   identifier.

Output file format

   urlget returns a file containing one or more URLs with a description.

   The -oformat qualifier provides a choice of formats which may be
   extended in future releases.

http://www.pseudomonas.com/getAnnotation.do?locusID=PA3363        Locus ID (Pseu
doCAP): PA3363
