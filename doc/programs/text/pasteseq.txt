                               Program pasteseq
                                       
Function

   Insert one sequence into another
   
Description

   This simple editing program allows you to insert one sequence into
   another sequence after a specified position and to then write out the
   results to a sequence file.
   
Usage

   To insert the sequence 'tst.seq' after position 67 in sequence
   'ese.seq' and write the results to the file 'estste.seq':
% pasteseq ese.seq tst.seq estste.seq -pos=67

   This is probably slightly more readable if the argument names are used
   instead of relying on the parameter positions:
% pasteseq -seq=ese.seq -ins=tst.seq -out=estste.seq -pos=67

   To insert the sequence 'tst.seq' before the start of sequence
   'ese.seq' use -pos=0 :
% pasteseq -seq=ese.seq -ins=tst.seq -out=estste.seq -pos=0

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          sequence   Sequence USA
  [-insseq]            sequence   Sequence to insert
  [-outseq]            seqout     Output sequence USA
   -pos                integer    The position in the main input sequence to
                                  insert after.
                                  To insert before the start use the position
                                  0.

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   General qualifiers:
  -help                bool       report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
