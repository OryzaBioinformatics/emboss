                               Program seqretall
                                       
Function

   Reads and writes (returns) a set of sequences one at a time
   
Description

   This application is now replaced by "seqret" which is the same.
   
   In early pre-release versions of EMBOSS, seqret read only one sequence
   so this program was needed to read more sequences. We have retained it
   for compatibility only.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with seqretall.

% seqretall
Reads and writes (returns) a set of sequences one at a time
Input sequence(s): embl:eclac*
Output sequence [eclac.fasta]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
  [-outseq]            seqoutall  Output sequence(s) USA

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   
   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   [-outseq]
   (Parameter 2) Output sequence(s) USA Writeable sequence(s)
   <sequence>.format
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

Output file format

   The output from seqretall is a set of sequences, and by default will
   be written in FASTA format all in one file.
   
   In some cases the output filename will be the same as the input
   filename, for example if you try to read the output from the example
   run with seqretall and give no output format.
   
   As seqretall reads only the first sequence before opening the output
   file it will overwrite the sequences before reading has completed,
   with unpredictable result. Note that this is not true of seqretset
   which reads all sequences into memory at startup.
