Function

   Remove carriage return from ASCII files

Description

   noreturn reads an input file of plain text containing unwanted carriage
   returns on the end of lines, and writes an output file which is
   identical to the input file, except that any trailing carriage returns
   are removed.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with noreturn


% noreturn abc.dat
Remove carriage return from ASCII files
ASCII text output file [abc.noreturn]:


   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example

Input file format

   The input file is a text data file with unwanted trailing carriage
   returns.

  Input files for usage example

  File: abc.dat

>ABC Test sequence with PC carriage return format
ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY

Output file format

  Output files for usage example

  File: abc.noreturn

>ABC Test sequence with PC carriage return format
ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY

   The output file is identical to the input file, except that any
   trailing carriage returns have been removed. For most files this will
   make no difference.

Data files

   None.

Notes

   Unix and PC operating systems store plain text files (which includes
   sequence files) slightly differently. Unix files have a hidden
   character called 'new line' at the end of every line whereas PC files
   have a 'new line' and a 'carriage return' at the end of every line.
   When files are transferred from a PC to a Unix machines, it is often
   useful to convert the file from the PC format to the Unix format,
   otherwise commands (such as 'more') and programs (such as text editors)
   that display the file can become confused. noreturn removes 'carriage
   return' characters from such files, converting them from PC format to
   Unix format text files.

   EMBOSS programs can read in both PC and Unix text file formats, so it
   is not necessary for you to use this utility all of the time.
