Function

   Removes carriage return from ASCII files
   
Description

   The way that Unix and PC operating systems store simple text files,
   (including sequence files), differs slightly.
   
   Unix files have a hidden character called 'new line' at the end of
   every line.
   
   PC files have two hidden characters called 'carriage return' and then
   'new line' at the end of every line.
   
   When files are transferred from PC machines to Unix machines, it is
   often useful to convert the file from the PC format to the Unix
   format, otherwise commands like 'more', to display the file, and text
   editors can become confused.
   
   This simple utility removes 'carriage return' characters from such
   files, converting them from PC format to Unix format text files.
   
   EMBOSS programs can read in both PC and Unix text file formats, so it
   is not necessary for you to use this utility all of the time.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with noreturn
   

% noreturn ../../data/abc.dat 
Removes carriage return from ASCII files
Output file [abc.noreturn]: 
   
   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example
   
Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-infile]            infile     (no help text) infile value
  [-outfile]           outfile    Output file name

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   General qualifiers:
  -help                boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-infile]
   (Parameter 1) (no help text) infile value Input file Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 2) Output file name Output file <sequence>.noreturn
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

   The input file is a text data file with unwanted trailing carriage
   returns.
   
  Input files for usage example
  
  File: ../../data/abc.dat
  
>ABC Test sequence with PC carriage return format
ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY
   
Output file format

  Output files for usage example
  
  File: abc.noreturn
  
>ABC Test sequence with PC carriage return format
ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY
   
   The output file is identical to the input file, except that any
   trailing carriage returns have been removed. For most files this will
   make no difference.
   
Data files

   None.
