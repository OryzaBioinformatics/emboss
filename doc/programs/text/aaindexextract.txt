Function

   Extract data from AAINDEX
   
Description

   aaextractindex extracts information from the AAINDEX database for use
   by pepwindow and pepwindowall
   
   AAINDEX is a database of properties of amino acids. See references [1]
   [2] [3].
   
   The programs pepwindow and pepwindowall normally use the standard
   EMBOSS data file 'Enakai.dat' by default, but you can set their
   '-data' qualifier to use any of the files produced by aaextractindex
   from the AAINDEX database.
   
   The AAINDEX database file 'aaindex1' can be downloaded from the
   AAINDEX site: ftp://ftp.genome.ad.jp/pub/db/genomenet/aaindex/aaindex1
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with aaindexextract:

% aaindexextract
Extract data from AAINDEX
Full pathname of file aaindex1: ~/aaindex1

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-inf]               infile     Full pathname of file aaindex1

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   General qualifiers:
  -help                boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-inf]
   (Parameter 1) Full pathname of file aaindex1 Input file Required
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

   The AAINDEX database file 'aaindex1' can be downloaded from the
   AAINDEX site: ftp://ftp.genome.ad.jp/pub/db/genomenet/aaindex/
   
Output file format

   One file for every entry in the AAINDEX database is created in the
   EMBOSS standard 'data/AAINDEX' directory. For example, the file
   'cham830102':
   
H CHAM830102
D A parameter defined from the residuals obtained from the best correlation
  of the Chou-Fasman parameter of beta-sheet (Charton-Charton, 1983)
R LIT:0907093b PMID:6876837
A Charton, M. and Charton, B.
T The dependence of the Chou-Fasman parameters on amino acid side chain
  structure
J J. Theor. Biol. 111, 447-450 (1983)

   None.
   
Notes

   If aaindexextract tries to write the data to an unexpected location
   you can explicitly set the location of the EMBOSS data directory by
   putting the line:
   
   ENV EMBOSS_DATA /path/to/the/EMBOSS/data/directory
   in the EMBOSS emboss.default file.
   
   (Where '/path/to/the/EMBOSS/data/directory' is the location of your
   EMBOSS data as unpacked from the distribution file.)
