Function

   Get ontology term(s) by id of child

Description

   ontogetup finds ontology terms matching a query. All parents of the
   term, related to the term by 'is_a' (class/subclass) relationships, are
   returned. The information may be written to an output file in various
   formats.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with ontogetup


% ontogetup edam:0001234
Get ontology term(s) by id of child

Input file format

   The input is a standard EMBOSS ontology query.

   The major ontology sources defined as standard in EMBOSS installations
   are EDAM, GO (gene Ontology) and SO (Sequence Ontology).

   Data can also be read from ontology output in "obo" format written by
   an EMBOSS application.

  Input files for usage example

  Database entry: edam:0001234

[Term]
id: EDAM:0001234
name: Sequence set (nucleic acid)
namespace: data
def: Any collection of multiple nucleotide sequences and associated metadata tha
t do not (typically) correspond to common sequence database records or database
entries.
subset: data
is_a: EDAM:0000850 ! Sequence set
is_a: EDAM:0002977 ! Nucleic acid sequence


Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS ontology term file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -oformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: obo,
   brief, list, html, xml, json, excel.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/OntologyFormats.html for further
   information on ontology formats.

  Output files for usage example

  File: 0001234.obo

[Term]
id: EDAM:0000850
name: Sequence set
namespace: data
def: A collection of multiple molecular sequences and associated metadata that d
o not (typically) correspond to molecular sequence database records or entries a
nd which (typically) are derived from some analytical method.
comment: This term may be used for arbitrary sequence sets and associated data a
rising from processing.
subset: data
is_a: EDAM:0002955 ! Sequence report

[Term]
id: EDAM:0002977
name: Nucleic acid sequence
namespace: data
def: One or more nucleic acid sequences, possibly with associated annotation.
subset: data
is_a: EDAM:0002044 ! Sequence
is_a: EDAM:0002525 ! Nucleic acid data


Data files

   The EDAM Ontology is included in EMBOSS as local database edam.
