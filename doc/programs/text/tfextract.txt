Function

   Process TRANSFAC transcription factor database for use by tfscan

Description

   tfextract extracts data from the TRANSFAC transcription factor database
   file site.dat (available from
   ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/transfac/) for other EMBOSS programs,
   such as tfscan, that use these data. The data is split up by taxonomic
   groups and placed in individual files that are stored in the EMBOSS
   data directory.

  File: tfplant


  File: tfother


   The output from tfextract is a set of files in the emboss/data
   directory containing reformatted sites from the transfac database.

   These files are used by the tfscan program to search for TRANSFAC sites
   in sequences.

Data files

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat


   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata". Files
   for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or again
   in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

Notes

   The TRANSFAC Database is a commercial database of eukaryotic cis-acting
   regulatory DNA elements and trans-acting factors. It covers the whole
   range from yeast to human. An old public domain version is available
   at: ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/transfac/transfac32.tar.Z

   TRANSFAC started in 1988 with a printed compilation (Nucleic Acids Res.
   16: 1879-1902, 1988) and was transferred into computer-readable format
   in 1990 (BioTechForum - Advances in Molecular Genetics (J. Collins,
   A.J. Driesel, eds.) 4:95-108, 1991). The basic structures of Table 1
   and 2 of the compilation were taken as the core of the emergent
   database. The aim of the early compilation as well as of the TRANSFAC
   database is: 1. to guide through a meanwhile overwhelming amount of
   data in a field which is connected to nearly all areas of modern
   molecular biology; 2. to map the regulatory sites in the individual
   genes and, ultimately, in the genome(s) as a whole; 3. to develop a
   tool for the identification of regulatory elements in newly unravelled
   genomic sequences; 4. to provide a basis for a more comprehensive
   understanding of how the genome governs transcriptional control.

   The program tfextract extracts data from the TRANSFAC database file
   site.dat. This file contains information on individual (putatively)
   regulatory protein binding sites. About half of these refer to sites
   within eukaryotic genes. Just under half of them resulted from
   mutagenesis studies, in vitro selection procedures starting from random
   oligonucleotide mixtures or from specific theoretical considerations.
   And finally, there are about 5% with consensus binding sequences given
   in the IUPAC code, many of them being taken from the compilation of
   Faisst and Meyer (Nucleic Acids Res. 20:3-26, 1992). A number of
   consensi have been generated by the TRANSFAC team, generally derived
   from the profiles stored in the MATRIX table.

   The data is split up by taxonomic groups:

     * Fungi
     * Insects
     * Plants
     * Vertebrates
     * Other

   and placed in individual files:
     * tffungi
     * tfinsect
     * tfplant
     * tfvertebrate
     * tfother

   These files are stored in the EMBOSS data directory, see Data Files
   below.
