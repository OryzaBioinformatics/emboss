Function

   Extract CDS, mRNA and translations from feature tables
   
Description

   The feature table of sequence database entries often have sections
   like this:

   joining several sections of code, many of which are in other entries
   in this database.

   It is often a tedious and error-prone job to extract the several
   sections of these sequences from the database entries and to join them
   together to construct the indicated finished sequence.
   
   coderet does this job for you.
   
   You specify the sequence containing the feature table and it extracts
   the required CDS, mRNA and/or protein sequences specified by this
   feature table. If any sequences are in other entries of that database,
   they are automatically fetched and incorporated correctly into the
   final sequence.
   
   The translations are not made from the coding sequence, they are
   extracted directly from the translation sequence held in the feature
   table.
   
Usage

   This means that the mRNA sequence is from position 179 to 500 in this
   sequence.
   The coding sequence is formed by joining the region from 387 to 500 in
   this sequence together with regions from two other entries in this
   database: X03488 and X03488.
   The translation of the coding sequence is also given.
   
   To extract all of the CDS, mRNA and the protein translations, type:
   
% coderet
Extract CDS, mRNA and translations from feature tables
Input sequence(s): embl:X03487
Output sequence [hsferg1.fasta]:

   The result is as follows:

   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   [-seqout]
   (Parameter 2) Output sequence USA Writeable sequence <sequence>.format
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -[no]cds Extract CDS sequences Yes/No Yes
   -[no]mrna Extract mrna sequences Yes/No Yes
   -[no]translation Extract translated sequences Yes/No Yes
   
Input file format

   USA of one or more nucleic sequences having CDS, mRNA or translation
   headings in their feature tables.
   
Output file format

   The output is a sequence file containing any CDS, mRNA and protein
   translation sequences as specified by the feature table of the
   sequence(s).
   
   One or more of CDS, mRNA, translation can be excluded from the output
   by using the appropriate qualifiers to the program (i.e. -nocds, etc.)
   
   The ID names of the output sequences are constructed from the name of
   the input sequence, the type of feature being output (i.e. cds, mrna,
   pro) and a unique ordinal number for this type to distinguish it from
   others in this sequence. The name, type and number of separated by
   underscore characters. Thus the second CDS feature in the sequence
   'HSXYZ' would be named 'HSXYZ_cds_2'.
   
   The translations are not made from the coding sequence, they are
   extracted directly from the translation sequence held in the feature
   table.
   
Data files

   None.
   
Notes

   The translations are not made from the coding sequence, they are
   extracted directly from the translation sequence held in the feature
   table.
