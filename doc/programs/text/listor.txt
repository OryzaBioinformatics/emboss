                                Program listor
                                       
Function

   Writes a list file of the logical OR of two sets of sequences
   
Description

   listor reads in two sets of sequences and writes out a list file (file
   of file names) that result from the logical union of these two sets of
   sequences. It is a simple way of manipulating and editing lists or
   sets of sequences to produce a list file.
   
   When comparing sequences to see if they are the same between two sets
   of sequences, no use is made of the ID name or accession number of the
   sequences. Only the sequences themselves are compared. The comparison
   of the sequences is case-independent.
   
   The logical union is an OR operation by default. Other available
   operations are: AND, XOR and NOT.
   
   The (default) logical OR of the two sets of sequences is simply the
   result of merging the two sets of sequences, (without listing any
   shared sequences twice).
   
   A logical AND simply lists those sequences that occur in both sets of
   sequences.
   
   A logical XOR lists those sequences that ONLY occur in the first set
   or only occur in the second set - sequences occuring in both sets are
   ignored (the opposite of an AND).
   
   A logical NOT lists all those sequences in the first set except for
   those that also occur in the second set.
   
   An example of the four types of logical operation performed with the
   two sets of sequences comprising these sequences follows. The two sets
   of sequences are in the files named file1 and file2. There are 2
   sequences which are duplicated between these two files ('two' and
   'three') and the sequences 'one' and 'four' are unique to the files
   'file1' and 'file2' respectively.
   
  file1
  
>one
tagctagcg
>two
tagctagcggctacgt
>three
tagctattttatgctacgtcagtgac

  file2
  
>two
tagctagcggctacgt
>three
tagctattttatgctacgtcagtgac
>four
gcgcggcgcgcgtgcgtcgttgctggggccc

   The results of the four types of logical union follows. Note that the
   duplicated sequences in these two files have been given the same name.
   This is not necessary for the operation of listor as it compares the
   sequences themselves, not the ID names of the sequences.
   
  OR gives:
  
fasta::file1:one
fasta::file1:two
fasta::file1:three
fasta::file2:four

  AND gives:
  
fasta::file1:two
fasta::file1:three

  XOR gives:
  
fasta::file1:one
fasta::file2:four

  NOT gives:
  
fasta::file1:one

Input file format

   The input sets of sequences can be of any valid USAs. The program was
   written to perform logical operations on list files, but in practice,
   wildcarded database entries and file names are also perfectly legal
   specifications of the input sequences.
   
Output file format

   The ouput is simply a list of the USAs (format and sequence
   specification) resulting from the required logical union of the two
   sets of input sequence.
   
   The order that the USAs are written out is not necessarily the same as
   the order of either of the input sets of sequences.
   
Data files

   None.
   
Notes

   The program stores all of the input sequences in memory while it is
   working out the logical unions of the two sets of sequences. This
   means that it is restricted by the available memory. Doing logical
   unions involving all of the sequences in large databases, such as
   EMBL, is probably impractical unless you are lucky enough to have
   extraordinary amounts of memory on your machine.
   
References

   None.
   
Warnings

   If you try to do a logical union with all of the sequences in EMBL and
   another sequence set, this program will attempt to read all of the
   EMBL sequences into memory at once. This will probably not succeed.
   
Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.
   
Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.
   
Known bugs

   None.
