Function

   Displays protein hydropathy
   
Description

   Protein sequences that form transmembrane regions are assumed to have
   a thermodynamic preference for a hydrophobic environment (inside the
   membrane lipid bilayer), rather than an aqueous environment in water.
   
   The free energy change for each amino acid residue between a lipid and
   a water environment can be measured experimentally, and the values for
   peptides can be shown to be additive (White and Wimley 1999).
   
   The octanol program calculates two free energy differences.
   
   The first is the free energy difference between solution in water and
   association with the interface (glycerol group) of a POPC
   (palmitoyloleoylphosphocholine) bilayer.
   
   The second is the free energy difference between water and octanol,
   equivalent to the environment inside a lipid bilayer.
   
   Residues which can be buried inside a lipid bilayer must be in a
   region of the peptide where most residues show a free energy
   difference in favour of being in an octanol environment or at least
   being in the lipid/water interface region.
   
   White and Wimley (1999) showed that a sliding window of either free
   energy difference will indicate the location of probably transmembrane
   regions, but that the best indicator is the difference between the two
   values, which is the free energy difference between the interface and
   octanol environments.
   
   The free energies are calculated over a sliding window of 19 residues,
   about the size of a membrane spanning alphahelix. The energy values
   for each residue are added over the window.

Output file format

   octanol draws a graph showing the free energy calcuated over a sliding
   window.
   
   The line on the default plot is the difference between the interface
   and octanol free energy calculations. Command line options allow the
   display of the interface and octanol values, or hiding the difference
   values.
   
   In the example, the human opsin protein has 7 transmembrane regions:
   37-61, 74-98, 114-133, 153-176, 203-230, 253-276 and 285-309. Each is
   about 20 residues in length, which is also the gap between tick marks
   on the sequence axis. All have energetic preferences for being in the
   lipid (octanol) enviroment - shown as being above the zero line - or
   have at least no clear preference.
   
   Running octanol with all three plots:

% octanol -interface -octanol
Input sequence: tsw:opsd_human
   Graph type [x11]:

   gives a graph with the water-interface and water-octanol plots (link
   to the output). For those regions where the diference plot is close to
   zero, both the other two plots are above the line, showing a
   preference for either the octanol or the interface membrane
   environments rather than water.
   
Data files

   File Ewhite-wimley.dat contains the experimental free energy values
   for the water-interface and water-octanol transitions.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
   
% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
