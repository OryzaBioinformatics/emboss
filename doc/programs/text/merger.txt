Function

   Merge two overlapping nucleic acid sequences
   
Description

   This joins two overlapping nucleic acid sequences into one merged
   sequence.
   
   It uses a global alignment algorithm (Needleman & Wunsch) to optimally
   align the sequences and then it creates the merged sequence from the
   alignment. When there is a mismatch in the alignment between the two
   sequences, the correct base to include in the resulting sequence is
   chosen by using the base from the sequence which has the best local
   sequence quality score. The following heuristic is used to find the
   sequence quality score:
   
   If one of the bases is a 'N', then the other sequence's base is used,
   else:
   
   A window size around the disputed base is used to find the local
   quality score. This window size is increased from 5, to 10 to 20 bases
   or until there is a clear decision on the best choice. If there is no
   best choice after using a window of 20, then the base in the first
   sequence is used.
   
   To calculate the quality of a window of a sequence around a base:
     * quality = sequence value/length under window either side of the
       base
     * sequence value = sum of points in that window
     * unambiguous bases (ACGTU) score 2 points
     * ambiguous bases (MRWSYKVHDB) score 1 point
     * Ns score 0 points
     * off end of the sequence scores 0 points
       
   N.B. This heavily discriminates against the iffy bits at the end of
   sequence reads.
   
   This program was originally written to aid in the reconstruction of
   mRNA sequences which had been sequenced from both ends as a 5' and 3'
   EST (cDNA). eg. joining two reads produced by primer walking
   sequencing.
   
   Care should be taken to reverse one of the sequences (e.g. using the
   qualifier '-sreverse2') if this is required to get them both in the
   correct orientation.
   
   Because it uses a Needleman & Wunsch alignment the required memory may
   be greater than the available memory when attempting to merge large
   (cosmid-sized or greater) sequences.
   
   The gap open and gap extension penalties have been set at a higher
   level than is usual (50 and 5). This was experimentally determined to
   give the best results with a set of poor quality EST test sequences.

   Typically, one of the sequences will need to be reverse-complemented
   to put it into the correct orientation to make it join. For example:
   
% merger file1.seq file2.seq -sreverse2 -out merged.seq

Input file format

Output file format

   The output sequence file contains the joined sequence, by default in
   FASTA format. Where there is a mismatch in the alignment, the chosen
   base is written to the output sequence in uppercase.
   
   The output report file contains descriptions of the positions where
   there is a mismatch in the alignment and shows the alignment. Where
   there is a mismatch in the alignment, the chosen base is written in
   uppercase.
   
   An example report file showing mismatches follows:
