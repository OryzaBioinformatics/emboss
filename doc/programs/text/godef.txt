Function

   Find GO ontology terms by definition

Description

   godef searches the definition of gene ontology terms and returns
   matching terms. The input is read from the installed GO database. The
   ontology term output can be written to screen, to file, or passed to
   another program. A wide range of standard ontology term formats may be
   specified for input and output.

   Optionally the search can be restricted to specified GO namespaces.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with godef


% godef glycoprotein

Command line arguments

Find GO ontology terms by definition
Version: EMBOSS:6.5.0.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-query]             string     Definition word(s) to search for in ontology

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -namespace          menu       [*] By default all terms are returned.
                                  Searches can be limited to one or a few
                                  namespaces. (Values: biological_process

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -subclasses         boolean    [N] Extend the query matches to include all

   -obsolete           boolean    [N] The default behaviour is to not use or
                                  return obsolete terms. This option if set
                                  will include all terms.

   Associated qualifiers:

   "-outfile" associated qualifiers
   -odirectory2        string     Output directory

Input file format

   godef queries the gene ontology.

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS ontology term file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -oformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: obo,
   brief, list, html, xml, json, excel.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/OntologyFormats.html for further
   information on ontology formats.
