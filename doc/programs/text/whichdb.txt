Function

   Search all databases for an entry
   
Description

   whichdb searches all available EMBOSS databases for sequences with a
   specified ID name or accession number.
   
   EMBOSS does not allow database entries to be specified by just the ID
   name or accession number. You must specify both the name of the
   database and the entry, for example 'embl:hsfau', not just 'hsfau'.
   
   If you do not know which database(s) contain the entry you are
   interested in, whichdb will tell you.
   
   whichdb can also, optionally, write out the sequences it finds to
   files.
   
  IDs and Accessions
  
   An entry in a database must have some way of being uniquely identified
   in that database. Most sequence databases have two such identifiers
   for each sequence - an ID name and an Accession number.
   
   Why are there two such identifiers? The ID name was originally
   intended to be a human-readable name that had some indication of the
   function of its sequence. In EMBL and GenBank the first two (or three)
   letters indicated the species and the rest indicated the function, for
   example 'hsfau' is the 'Homo Sapiens FAU pseudogene'. This naming
   scheme started to be a problem when the number of entries added each
   day was so vast that people could not make up the ID names fast
   enough. Instead, the Accession numbers were used as the ID name.
   Therefore you will now find ID names like 'AF061303', the same as the
   Accession number for that sequence in EMBL.
   
   ID names are not guaranteed to remain the same between different
   versions of a database (although in practice they usually do).
   
   Accession numbers are unique alphanumeric identifiers that are
   guaranteed to remain with that sequence through the rest of the life
   of the database. If two sequences are merged into one, then the new
   sequence will get a new Accession number and the Accession numbers of
   the merged sequences will be retained as 'secondary' Accession
   numbers.
   
   EMBL, GenBank and SwissProt share an Accession numbering scheme - an
   Accession number uniquely identifies a sequence within these three
   databases.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with whichdb:

% whichdb
Search all databases for an entry
ID or Accession number: hsfau
Output file [outfile.whichdb]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-entry]             string     ID or Accession number
*  -outfile            outfile    Output file name

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -get                boolean    Retrieve sequences

   General qualifiers:
  -help                boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-entry]
   (Parameter 1) ID or Accession number Any string is accepted An empty
   string is accepted
   -outfile Output file name Output file <sequence>.whichdb
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -get Retrieve sequences Yes/No No
   
Input file format

   None.
   
Output file format

   The reported database entries are written out to the specified output
   file.
   
   The results from the above example follow:
     _________________________________________________________________
   
embl:hsfau
human:hsfau
tembl:hsfau
em:hsfau
genbank:hsfau
gb:hsfau
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   Each database that is defined in the local implementation of EMBOSS
   which contains an entry called 'hsfau' is reported.
   
   Note that where a database is defined under several names ('embl',
   'em'), each definition of that database containing the entry is
   reported.
   
   When the '-get' option is used to output the sequences, they are
   written to separate files. The sequence format they are written in is
   always 'Fasta' format. The normal command-line qualifiers for changing
   the output formats etc. will not work in this program.
   
   The names of the files that the sequences are written to is reported
   as they are written, for example:
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Writing hsfau.embl
Writing hsfau.human
Writing hsfau.tembl
Writing hsfau.em
Writing hsfau.genbank
Writing hsfau.gb
