Function

   Generates server cache file for Dbfetch/WSDbfetch data sources

Description

   Contacts the EBI dbfetch service to find the available databases and
   saves definitions for them to a server cache file.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with cachedbfetch


% cachedbfetch -servername tdbfetch -auto -cachefile ~/.embossdata/qatests.serve

Input file format

   cachedbfetch contacts the EBI dbfetch server for details of available
   databases.

Output file format

   cachedbfetch writes a server cache file which can be saved in the
   user's .embossdata directory or, for a system administrator, stored in
   the site-wide share/EMBOSS/ directory.
