Function

   Reports protein signal cleavage sites
   
Description

   SigCleave uses the method of von Heijne as modified by von Heijne in
   his later book where treatment of positions -1 and -3 in the matrix is
   slightly altered (see references).
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with sigcleave.

% sigcleave
Reports peptide signal cleavage sites
Input sequence: sw:ach2_drome
Output file [ach2_drome.out]:
Minimum weight [3.5]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
   -minweight          float      Minimum scoring weight value for the

Input file format

   The input sequence can be one or more protein sequences.
   
Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS report file.
   
   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -rformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: embl,
   genbank, gff, pir, swiss, trace, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq, excel,
   feattable, motif, regions, seqtable, simple, srs, table, tagseq
   
   See:
   http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Themes/ReportFormats.html for
   further information on report formats.
   
   By default sigcleave writes a 'motif' report file.
   
   The output from the above example is:

Data files

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
       
   The data file names are:
     * Esig.euk Eukaryotic signal data
     * Esig.pro Prokaryotic signal data
       
   Here is the default file for eukaryotic signals:

Notes

   The value of minweight should be at least 3.5. At this level, the
   method should correctly identify 95% of signal peptides, and reject
   95% of non-signal peptides. The cleavage site should be correctly
   predicted in 75-80% of cases.
   
   If you use matrix tables with a different number of residues before or
   after the cleavage site, you must also set the advanced parameters
   nval and pval.
