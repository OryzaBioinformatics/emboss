                               Program sigcleave
                                       
Function

   Reports protein signal cleavage sites
   
Description

   SigCleave uses the method of von Heijne as modified by von Heijne in
   his later book where treatment of positions -1 and -3 in the matrix is
   slightly altered (see references).
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with sigcleave.

Input file format

   The input sequence can be one or more protein sequences.
   
Output file format

   The output from sigcleave is a simple text one. Maxsite is the amino
   acid position immediately after the predicted cleavage site. Score is
   the calculated weight value for the predicted cleavage site. Sequence
   shows the amino acid positions used to calculate the score with "-"
   used to indicate the predicted cleavage site. Here is a sample output:

Data files

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
       
   The data file names are:
     * Esig.euk Eukaryotic signal data
     * Esig.pro Prokaryotic signal data
       
   Here is the default file for eukaryotic signals:

Notes

   The value of minweight should be at least 3.5. At this level, the
   method should correctly identify 95% of signal peptides, and reject
   95% of non-signal peptides. The cleavage site should be correctly
   predicted in 75-80% of cases.
   
   If you use matrix tables with a different number of residues before or
   after the cleavage site, you must also set the advanced parameters
   nval and pval.
