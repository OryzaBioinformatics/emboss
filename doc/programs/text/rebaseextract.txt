                             Program rebaseextract
                                       
Function

   Extract data from REBASE
   
Description

   The Restriction Enzyme database (REBASE) is a collection of
   information about restriction enzymes and related proteins. It
   contains published and unpublished references, recognition and
   cleavage sites, isoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation
   sensitivity, crystal and sequence data. DNA methyltransferases, homing
   endonucleases, nicking enzymes, specificity subunits and control
   proteins are also included. Most recently, putative DNA
   methyltransferases and restriction enzymes, as predicted from analysis
   of genomic sequences, are also listed.
   
   The home page of REBASE is: http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html
   
   This program derives recognition site and cleavage information from
   the "withrefm" file of an REBASE distribution. It creates three files
   in the EMBOSS data subdirectory REBASE. A pattern file, a reference
   file and a supplier file.
   
   The EMBOSS programs that find restriction cutting sites use the data
   files produced by this program and will not work without them.
   
   Running this program may be the job of your system manager.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with rebaseextract.

% rebaseextract
Full pathname of WITHREFM: /data/rebase/withrefm.904


Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-inf]               infile     Full pathname of WITHREFM

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   
   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-inf]
   (Parameter 1) Full pathname of WITHREFM Input file Required
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

   The input file must be the "withrefm" file of a REBASE distribution.
   
   For example, the withrefm file for REBASE version 005 is at:
   ftp://ftp.neb.com/pub/rebase/withrefm.005
   
Output file format

   The output files are held in the REBASE subdirectory of the EMBOSS
   data directory. There are three:
     * embossre.enz Enzyme pattern file
     * embossre.ref Enzyme references
     * embossre.sup Enzyme suppliers
       
   Here are examples of the three formats:
     * a) Enzyme file
#             length  cuts     blunt    3'      5'     [3']    [5']
AlwI    GGATC   5       2       0       9       10      0       0
Alw21I  GWGCWC  6       2       0       5       1       0       0
Alw26I  GTCTC   5       2       0       6       10      0       0
Alw44I  GTGCAC  6       2       0       1       5       0       0
     * b) Reference file

Data files

   The "withrefm" file of an REBASE distribution is the input file for
   this program.
   
Notes
