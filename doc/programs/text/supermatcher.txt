                             Program supermatcher
                                       
Function

   Finds a match of a large sequence against one or more sequences
   
Description

   This is a rough and ready local alignment program for large sequences.
   The reason it is rough and ready is that wordmatch is used to find all
   the wordmatches between the first sequence and another sequence. Then
   by calculating the highest score for a diagonal we can then use this
   as the centre point for a Smith-Waterman type calculation of a width
   given by the user. So a narrow diagonal smith-waterman is calculated
   hence the results will be rough but due to the space saving much
   larger sequences can be aligned.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with supermatcher.

 supermatcher ~/wordtest/U68037 ~/wordtest/AB003171 -noscoreonly

Finds a match of a large sequence against one or more sequences
Gap opening penalty [10.0]:
Gap extension penalty [0.5]: 3.0
Output file [stdout]:

Input file format

   Two sequence USAs.
   
Output file format

   supermatcher.error will contain any errors that occured during the
   program. This maybe that wordmatch could not find any matches hence no
   suitable start point is found for the smith-waterman calculation.
   
Data files

   For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution matrix.
   For nucleotide sequence, EDNAMAT is used. Others can be specified.
   
Notes

   The time this program takes to do an alignment depends very much on
   the word size. For short sequences a short word size (e.g. 4) can make
   it take a very long time. Large word sizes (e.g. 30) for sequences
   that are very similar give a very quick result. The default of 16
   should give reasonable fast alignments.
   
   Because it does a Smith & Waterman alignment (albeit in a narrow
   region around the diagonal shown to be the 'best' by a word match),
   this program can use huge amounts of memory if the sequences are
   large.
   
   Because the alignment is made within a narrow area each side of the
   'best' diagonal, if there are sufficient indels between the two
   sequences, then the path of the Smith & Waterman alignment can wander
   outside of this area. Making the width larger can avoid this problem,
   but you then use more memory.
   
   The longer the sequences and the wider the specified alignment width,
   the more memory will be used.
   
   If the program terminates due to lack of memory you can try the
   following:
   
   Run the UNIX command 'limit' to see if your stack or memory usage have
   been limited and if so, run 'unlimit', (e.g.: '% unlimit stacksize').
