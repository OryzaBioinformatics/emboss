Function

   Finds the best local alignments between two sequences
   
Description

   matcher compares two sequences looking for local sequence similarities
   using a rigorous algorithm.
   
   matcher is based on Bill Pearson's 'lalign' application, version 2.0u4
   Feb. 1996
   
   Lalign uses code developed by X. Huang and W. Miller (Adv. Appl. Math.
   (1991) 12:337-357) for the "sim" program, which is a linear-space
   version of an algorithm described by M. S. Waterman and M. Eggert (J.
   Mol. Biol. 197:723-728).
   
   Like water, matcher is rigorous, but also very slow. The advantage of
   matcher is that it uses far less memory than water, so you are much
   less likely to run out of memory when aligning large sequences.
   
   matcher will also report a specified number of alignments between the
   two sequences showing the actual local alignments. (water will only
   report the single best match.) The default number of alignments output
   is 1, but can be increased to (for example) the 10 best alignments by
   using the '-alternatives 10' command-line qualifier. In some cases,
   for example multidomain proteins or cDNA and genomic DNA comparisons,
   there may be many interesting and significant alignments.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with matcher.
   
% matcher sw:hba_human sw:hbb_human
Finds the best local alignments between two sequences
Output file [hba_human.matcher]:

   Here is an example to find the 10 best alignments:
   
% matcher sw:hba_human sw:hbb_human -alt 10
Finds the best local alignments between two sequences
Output file [hba_human.matcher]: hba_human.matcher10

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequencea]         sequence   Sequence USA
  [-sequenceb]         sequence   Sequence USA
  [-outfile]           outfile    Output file name

   Optional qualifiers:
   -datafile           matrix     Matrix file
   -alternatives       integer    This sets the number of alternative matches
                                  output. By default only the highest scoring
                                  alignment is shown. A value of 2 gves you
                                  other reasonable alignments. In some cases,
                                  for example multidomain proteins of cDNA and
                                  gemomic DNA comparisons, there may be other
                                  interesting and significant alignments.
   -gappenalty         integer    The gap penalty is the score taken away when
                                  a gap is created. The best value depends on
                                  the choice of comparison matrix. The
                                  default value of 14 assumes you are using
                                  the EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein sequences,
                                  or a value of 16 and the EDNAFULL matrix for
                                  nucleotide sequences.
   -gaplength          integer    The gap length, or gap extension, penalty is
                                  added to the standard gap penalty for each
                                  base or residue in the gap. This is how long
                                  gaps are penalized. Usually you will expect
                                  a few long gaps rather than many short
                                  gaps, so the gap extension penalty should be
                                  lower than the gap penalty. An exception is
                                  where one or both sequences are single
                                  reads with possible sequencing errors in
                                  which case you would expect many single base
                                  gaps. You can get this result by setting
                                  the gap penalty to zero (or very low) and
                                  using the gap extension penalty to control
                                  gap scoring.
   -markx              integer    This sets the alternate display of matches
                                  and mismatches in alignments.
                                  -markx=0 uses ':','.',' ', for identities,
                                  conservative replacements, and
                                  non-conservative replacements, respectively.
                                  -markx=1 uses ' ','x', and 'X'.
                                  -markx=2 does not show the second sequence,
                                  but uses the second alignment line to
                                  display matches with a '.' for identity, or
                                  with the mismatched residue for mismatches.
                                  -markx=3 outputs a title line with the
                                  percentage identity and score and then
                                  outputs the gapped sequences in multiple
                                  FASTA format.
                                  -markx=4 outputs only the title line with
                                  the percentage identity and score.
                                  -markx=5,6,7,8 and 9 are the same as
                                  -markx=1
                                  -markx=10 outputs a parseable output.
   -length             integer    Number of residues per line

   Advanced qualifiers: (none)

   (Parameter 3) Output file name Output file <sequence>.matcher
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -datafile Matrix file Comparison matrix file in EMBOSS data path
   EBLOSUM62 for protein
   EDNAFULL for DNA
   -alternatives This sets the number of alternative matches output. By
   default only the highest scoring alignment is shown. A value of 2 gves
   you other reasonable alignments. In some cases, for example
   multidomain proteins of cDNA and gemomic DNA comparisons, there may be
   other interesting and significant alignments. Integer 1 or more 1
   -gappenalty The gap penalty is the score taken away when a gap is
   created. The best value depends on the choice of comparison matrix.
   The default value of 14 assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62 matrix for
   protein sequences, or a value of 16 and the EDNAFULL matrix for
   nucleotide sequences. Positive integer 14 for protein, 16 for nucleic
   -gaplength The gap length, or gap extension, penalty is added to the
   standard gap penalty for each base or residue in the gap. This is how
   long gaps are penalized. Usually you will expect a few long gaps
   rather than many short gaps, so the gap extension penalty should be
   lower than the gap penalty. An exception is where one or both
   sequences are single reads with possible sequencing errors in which
   case you would expect many single base gaps. You can get this result
   by setting the gap penalty to zero (or very low) and using the gap
   extension penalty to control gap scoring. Positive integer 4 for any
   sequence
   -markx This sets the alternate display of matches and mismatches in
   alignments. -markx=0 uses ':','.',' ', for identities, conservative
   replacements, and non-conservative replacements, respectively.
   -markx=1 uses ' ','x', and 'X'. -markx=2 does not show the second
   sequence, but uses the second alignment line to display matches with a
   '.' for identity, or with the mismatched residue for mismatches.
   -markx=3 outputs a title line with the percentage identity and score
   and then outputs the gapped sequences in multiple FASTA format.
   -markx=4 outputs only the title line with the percentage identity and
   score. -markx=5,6,7,8 and 9 are the same as -markx=1 -markx=10 outputs
   a parseable output. Integer up to 10 0
   -length Number of residues per line Integer from 1 to 200 60
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default

   Note that the parseable output starts each alignment record with ">>"
   while each aligned sequence record starts with ">".
   
   All parameters produced will be of the form: ; xx_yyyyy
   
   In this version, we have xx: sw - Smith-Waterman scores sq - sequence
   length, type al - alignment start, stop, display_offset
   
   All of the output parameters correspond to values that are presented
   in other output formats, with the exception of the "al_" parameters.
   
   al_start gives the location of the alignment start in the original
   sequence
   
   al_stop gives the location of the end of the alignment in the original
   sequence
   
   al_display_start gives the location of the first displayed amino acid
   residue in the original sequence. The -markx=10 alignments are the
   same as those produced in the other modes. If the beginning of the
   first sequence aligns with the 10'th residue of the second sequence,
   then the first sequence will be padded with ten leading "-" to produce
   the alignment. The leading '-' are a formatting convenience only; they
   are not considered in the numbering system for al_display_start,

   For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution matrix.
   For nucleotide sequence, EDNAFULL is used.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

   Program name Description
   seqmatchall Does an all-against-all comparison of a set of sequences
   supermatcher Finds a match of a large sequence against one or more
   sequences
   water Smith-Waterman local alignment
   wordmatch Finds all exact matches of a given size between 2 sequences
   
   water will give a single best rigorous local alignment. It will use
   memory of the order of the product of the lengths of the sequences to
   be aligned. If you wish the 'best' local alignment you should use
   water. If you run out of memory or want several possible good
   alignments, use matcher.
