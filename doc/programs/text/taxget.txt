Function

   Get taxon(s)

Description

   taxget reads in one or more taxons and writes them out again. The taxon
   input may be a literal sequence or read from a database, file, file of
   taxon names, or even the command-line or the output of another
   programs. The taxon output can be written to screen, to file, or passed
   to another program. A wide range of standard taxon formats may be
   specified for input and output.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with taxget


% taxget ttax:9606

Input file format

   The input is a standard EMBOSS taxonomy query.

   The expected source of taxonomy information is the NCBI Taxonomy
   database "taxon" which is available as a standard database in all
   EMBOSS installations.

   Data can also be read from taxonomy output in "ncbi" format written by
   an EMBOSS application.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/TaxonFormats.html for further
   information on taxon formats.

  Input files for usage example

   'ttax:9606' is a sequence entry in the example taxonomy database 'ttax'

  Database entry: ttax:9606

id: 9606
parent: 9605
rank: species
emblprefix: HS
division: 5
divflag: 1
gencode: 1
gcflag: 1
mitocode: 2
mgcflag 1
hidden: 1
nosequence: 1
scientific name: Homo sapiens

genbank common name: human
common name: man


Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS taxon file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -oformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: ncbi, ebi,
   tax, excel.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/TaxonFormats.html for further
   information on taxon formats.
