Function

   Shows molwts that match across a set of files
   
Description

   mwcontam finds molecular weights that are common between a set of mass
   spectrometry result files. Such molecular weights are usually a form
   of contamination resulting from autolysis of a protease, degradation
   of the matrix or presence of keratin from the sample preparer.
   
   The output of mwcontam, with minimal editing, can be added to the data
   file for the mwfilter program ('Emwfilter.dat').
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with mwcontam:
   
% mwcontam
Shows molwts that match across a set of files
Comma separated file list: mw1.dat,mw2.dat,mw3.dat
ppm tolerance [50.0]:
Output file [outfile.mwcontam]:

                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-files]
   (Parameter 1) Comma separated file list Comma-separated file list
   comma-separated file list
   -tolerance ppm tolerance Any numeric value 50.0

Input file format

   The input is a comma-separated list of files containing simple list of
   experimental molecular weights.
   
   There should be one weight per line.
   
   Comments in the data file start with a '#' character in the first
   column.
   
   Blank lines are ignored.
   
   An example of the input data files follows:
   
File mw1.dat:
  __________________________________________________________________________

20.0
33.0
67.0
128.0
415.0
999.0
  __________________________________________________________________________


File mw2.dat:
  __________________________________________________________________________

13.0
41.0
67.0
415.0
846.0
781.0
  __________________________________________________________________________


File mw3.dat:
  __________________________________________________________________________

3.0
18.0
67.0
124.0
197.0
236.0
415.0
587.0
632.0
  __________________________________________________________________________

Output file format

   The output is a list of the molecular weights common to all files.
   
   An example of the output data follows:
     _________________________________________________________________
   
67.000
415.000
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Data files

   mwcontam uses no data files.
   
   The output of mwcontam, with minimal editing, can be added to the data
   file for the mwfilter program ('Emwfilter.dat'). For example you might
   like to fetch 'Emwfilter.dat' using embossdata (as described in the
   mwfilter documentation) and edit it to include the lines:
     _________________________________________________________________
   
# data produced from the program mwcontam
mwcontam        67.000
mwcontam        415.000
     _________________________________________________________________
