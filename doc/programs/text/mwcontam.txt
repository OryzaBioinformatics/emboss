Function

   Shows molwts that match across a set of files
   
Description

   mwcontam finds molecular weights that are common between a set of mass
   spectrometry result files. Such molecular weights are usually a form
   of contamination resulting from autolysis of a protease, degradation
   of the matrix or presence of keratin from the sample preparer.
   
   The output of mwcontam, with minimal editing, can be added to the data
   file for the mwfilter program ('Emwfilter.dat').
   
Usage

Input file format

  Input files for usage example
  
  File: ../../data/mw1.dat
  
20.0
33.0
67.0
128.0
415.0
999.0
   
  File: ../../data/mw2.dat
  
13.0
41.0
67.0
415.0
846.0
781.0
   
  File: ../../data/mw3.dat
  
3.0
18.0
67.0
124.0
197.0
236.0
415.0
587.0
632.0
   
   The input is a comma-separated list of files containing simple list of
   experimental molecular weights.
   
   There should be one weight per line.
   
   Comments in the data file start with a '#' character in the first
   column.
   
   Blank lines are ignored.
   
Output file format

   The output is a list of the molecular weights common to all files.
   
  Output files for usage example
  
  File: outfile.mwcontam
  
67.000
415.000
   
Data files

   mwcontam uses no data files.
   
   The output of mwcontam, with minimal editing, can be added to the data
   file for the mwfilter program ('Emwfilter.dat'). For example you might
   like to fetch 'Emwfilter.dat' using embossdata (as described in the
   mwfilter documentation) and edit it to include the lines:
     _________________________________________________________________
   
# data produced from the program mwcontam
mwcontam        67.000
mwcontam        415.000
     _________________________________________________________________
