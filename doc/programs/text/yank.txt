Function

   Reads a sequence range, appends the full USA to a list file
   
Description

   yank is a simple utility to add a specified sequence name to a list
   file.
   
   In fact, it writes out not just the name of the sequence, but also the
   start and end position of a region within that sequence and, if the
   sequence is nucleic, if can specify whether the sequence is the
   reverse complement.
   
   Many EMBOSS programs can read in a set of sequences. (Some examples
   are emma and union) There are many ways of specifying these sequences,
   including wildcarded sequence file names, wildcarded database entry
   names and list files. List files (files of file names) are the most
   flexible. yank is a utility to add sequences to a list file.
   
   Instead of containing the sequences themselves, a List file contains
   "references" to sequences - so, for example, you might include
   database entries, the names of files containing sequences, or even the
   names of other list files. For example, here's a valid list file,
   called seq.list:
   
unix % more seq.list

opsd_abyko.fasta
sw:opsd_xenla
sw:opsd_c*
@another_list

   This looks a bit odd, but it's really very straightforward; the file
   contains:
   
     * opsd_abyko.fasta - this is the name of a sequence file. The file
       is read in from the current directory.
     * sw:opsd_xenla - this is a reference to a specific sequence in the
       SwissProt database
     * sw:opsd_c* - this represents all the sequences in SwissProt whose
       identifiers start with ``opsd_c''
     * another_list - this is the name of a second list file
       
   Notice the @ in front of the last entry. This is the way you tell
   EMBOSS that this file is a list file, not a regular sequence file.
   
   Without the program yank you would need to use a text editor such as
   pico to create the appropriate list files. yank makes this process
   easy.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with yank, adding the regions making up the
   coding sequence of embl:hsfau1 to the list 'cds.list':

% yank
Reads a range from a sequence, appends the full USA to a list file
Input sequence: em:hsfau1
     Begin at position [start]: 782
       End at position [end]: 856
        Reverse strand [N]:
Output file [hsfau1.yank]: cds.list

% yank
Reads a range from a sequence, appends the full USA to a list file
Input sequence: em:hsfau1
     Begin at position [start]: 951
       End at position [end]: 1095
        Reverse strand [N]:
Output file [hsfau1.yank]: cds.list

% yank
Reads a range from a sequence, appends the full USA to a list file
Input sequence: em:hsfau1
     Begin at position [start]: 1557
       End at position [end]: 1612
        Reverse strand [N]:
Output file [hsfau1.yank]: cds.list

% yank
Reads a range from a sequence, appends the full USA to a list file
Input sequence: em:hsfau1
     Begin at position [start]: 1787
       End at position [end]: 1912
        Reverse strand [N]:
Output file [hsfau1.yank]: cds.list

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          sequence   Sequence USA
  [-outfile]           outfile    Output file name

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -newfile            boolean    Overwrite existing output file

   General qualifiers:
  -help                boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence USA Readable sequence Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 2) Output file name Output file <sequence>.yank
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -newfile Overwrite existing output file Yes/No No
   
Input file format

   Any valid sequence can be read in.
   
   You will be prompted for the start and end positions you wish to use.
   
   If the sequence is nucleic, you will be prompted whether you wish to
   use the reverse complement of the sequence.
   
Output file format

   The result file 'cds.list' of the example above is:
   
em-id:HSFAU1[782:856]
em-id:HSFAU1[951:1095]
em-id:HSFAU1[1557:1612]
em-id:HSFAU1[1787:1912]

   This can now be read in by a program such as union by specifying the
   list file as '@cds.list' when union prompts for input.
