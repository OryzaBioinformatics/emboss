Function

   Index a GCG formatted database
   
Description

   dbigcg indexes a GCG-format database of one or more files, and builds
   EMBL CD-ROM format index files.
   
   A GCG-format database consists of *.seq and *.ref files - only the
   *.seq files are used. The data in these is often compressed.
   
   The resulting index-file format is used by the software on the EMBL
   database CD-ROM distribution and by the Staden package in addition to
   EMBOSS, and appears to be the most generally used and publicly
   available index file format for these databases.
   
   Having created the EMBOSS indices for this file, a database can then
   be defined in the file emboss.defaults as something like:
   
DB embl [
   type: N
   format: embl
   method: gcg
   directory: /data/gcg/gcgembl
]

  Fields Indexed
  
   By default, dbigcg will index the ID name and the accession number (if
   present).
   If they are present in your database, you may also specify that
   dbiflat should index the Sequence Version and GI number, the Keywords
   and Taxonomy names and the words in the description by using the
   '-fields' qualifier with the appropriate values.

Input file format

   dbigcg reads in a GCG-format database. A GCG-format database consists
   of *.seq and *.ref files - only the *.seq files are used. The data in
   these is often compressed.
   
Output file format

  Output files for usage example
  
  File: acnum.hit
  
   This file contains non-printing characters and so cannot be displayed
   here.
   
  File: acnum.trg
  
   This file contains non-printing characters and so cannot be displayed
   here.
   
  File: division.lkp
  
   This file contains non-printing characters and so cannot be displayed
   here.
   
  File: entrynam.idx
  
   This file contains non-printing characters and so cannot be displayed
   here.
   
   dbigcg creates four index files. All are binary but with a simple
   format.
     * division.lkp is the master index file, and has a 300 byte header
       containing the database name and date plus information on the
       record size. This header is followed by one record for each
       database file, giving the full file names for the reference file
       and sequence file.
     * entryname.idx is the entry name index. It has the same 300 byte
       header, mainly used to store the record size which will depend on
       the size of the longest entryname in the database. Each entry is
       stored in sorted alphanumeric order so that a binary search can be
       used to efficiently find any record. The record also holds the
       file number from division.lkp and the offsets in the data and
       sequence files for that entry.
     * acnum.trg holds the accession number information. The file has the
       usual 300 byte header, and a sorted list of record by accession
       number. Each accession number record contains the first record
       number in acnum.hit and the total number of records in acnum.hit
       so that secondary (duplicated) accession numbers can be searched.
     * acnum.hit is a very simple file. After the usual 300 byte header,
       each record simply holds the record number in entryname.idx. An
       accession number search will use acnum.trg to find a start
       position and number of records to read in this file, and will then
       simply read the entryname.idx records for each entry in turn.
