                                Program getorf
                                       
Function

   Finds and extracts open reading frames (ORFs)
   
Description

   This program finds and outputs the sequences of open reading frames
   (ORFs).
   
   The ORFs can be defined as regions of a specified minimum size between
   STOP codons or between START and STOP codons.
   
   The ORFs can be output as the nucleotide sequence or as the
   translation.
   
   The program can also output the region around the START or the initial
   STOP codon or the ending STOP codons of an ORF for those doing
   analysis of the properties of these regions.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with getorf.

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
  [-outseq]            seqoutall  Output sequence(s) USA

   Optional qualifiers:
   -table              list       Code to use
   -minsize            integer    Minimum nucleotide size of ORF to report
   -find               list       This is a small menu of possible output
                                  options. The first four options are to
                                  select either the protein translation or the
                                  original nucleic acid sequence of the open
                                  reading frame. There are two possible
                                  definitions of an open reading frame: it can
                                  either be a region that is free of STOP
                                  codons or a region that begins with a START
                                  codon and ends with a STOP codon. The last
                                  three options are probably only of interest
                                  to people who wish to investigate the
                                  statistical properties of the regions around
                                  potential START or STOP codons. The last
                                  option assumes that ORF lengths are
                                  calculated between two STOP codons.

   Advanced qualifiers:
   -[no]methionine     bool       START codons at the beginning of protein
                                  products will usually code for Methionine,
                                  despite what the codon will code for when it
                                  is internal to a protein. This qualifier
                                  sets all such START codons to code for
                                  Methionine by default.
   -circular           bool       Is the sequence circular
   -[no]reverse        bool       Set this to be false if you do not wish to
                                  find ORFs in the reverse complement of the
                                  sequence.
   -flanking           integer    If you have chosen one of the options of the
                                  type of sequence to find that gives the
                                  flanking sequence around a STOP or START
                                  codon, this allows you to set the number of
                                  nucleotides either side of that codon to
                                  output. If the region of flanking
                                  nucleotides crosses the start or end of the
                                  sequence, no output is given for this codon.

   -find This is a small menu of possible output options. The first four
   options are to select either the protein translation or the original
   nucleic acid sequence of the open reading frame. There are two
   possible definitions of an open reading frame: it can either be a
   region that is free of STOP codons or a region that begins with a
   START codon and ends with a STOP codon. The last three options are
   probably only of interest to people who wish to investigate the
   statistical properties of the regions around potential START or STOP
   codons. The last option assumes that ORF lengths are calculated
   between two STOP codons.

   1 (Translation of regions between START and STOP codons)
   2 (Nucleic sequences between STOP codons)
   3 (Nucleic sequences between START and STOP codons)

   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -[no]methionine START codons at the beginning of protein products will
   usually code for Methionine, despite what the codon will code for when
   it is internal to a protein. This qualifier sets all such START codons
   to code for Methionine by default. Yes/No Yes
   -circular Is the sequence circular Yes/No No
   -[no]reverse Set this to be false if you do not wish to find ORFs in
   the reverse complement of the sequence. Yes/No Yes
   -flanking If you have chosen one of the options of the type of
   sequence to find that gives the flanking sequence around a STOP or
   START codon, this allows you to set the number of nucleotides either
   side of that codon to output. If the region of flanking nucleotides
   crosses the start or end of the sequence, no output is given for this
   codon. Any integer value 100
   
Input file format

   Any nucleic acid sequence USA.

   longer than the minimum size, which defaults to 30 bases or 10 amino
   acids.

   All output ORF sequences are written to the specified outut file.
   
   The name of the ORF sequences is constructed from the name of the
   input sequence with an underscore character ('_') and a unique ordinal
   number of the ORF found appended. The description of the output ORF
   sequence is constructed from the description of the input sequence
   with the start and end positions of the ORF prepended.
   
   The unique number appended to the name is simply used to create new
   unique sequence names, it does not imply any further information
   indicating any order, positioning or sense-strand of the ORFs.
   
   If the ORF has been found in the reverse sense, then the start
   position will be smaller than the end position. The numbering uses the
   forward-sense positions, but read in the reverse sense. For example,
   ;gt&ECLACI_3 [465 - 49] in the output above is a reverse-sense ORF
   running from position 465 to 49.
