Function

   Removes non-alphabetic (e.g. gap) characters from sequences

Description

   degapseq reads one or more sequences and writes them out again but
   stripped of any non-alphabetic characters. It's main purpose is to
   remove gap characters from aligned sequences, but it will also remove
   such things as the symbol for translation STOP ('*') in a protein
   sequence.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with degapseq


% degapseq dnagap.fasta nogaps.seq
Removes non-alphabetic (e.g. gap) characters from sequences

Input file format

   Any valid input sequence USA is allowed.

   The input sequence can be nucleic or protein.

   The input sequence can be gapped or ungapped.

  Input files for usage example

  File: dnagap.fasta

>FASTA F10002 FASTA FORMAT DNA SEQUENCE
ACGT....ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT
ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT
ACGTACGTACGTACGTACGT

Output file format

   The output is a sequence with no gaps.

Data files

   None.

Notes

   There are many different formats for storing molecular sequences in
   files. Some formats are specifically for aligned sequences, where gaps
   are inserted into the sequences for purposes of alignment. Gaps are
   indicated with different characters depending on the format in
   question, but commonly include '.', '-' and '~'. Some formats use more
   than one type of character to indicate different types of gaps, for
   example gaps at the sequence ends, internal gaps, gaps inserted by a
   program and gaps inserted manually by a person editing the alignment
   may all be denoted with different characters.

   EMBOSS uses the dash character ('-') only to indicate gaps. When an
   EMBOSS program reads a sequence with gaps, all gap characters are
   changed internally to a dash ('-'). Thus any distinguishing characters
   for different gap types are convered to a '-' on output.

References

   None.

Warnings

   It will remove '*' characters from protein sequences as well as
   removing the gap characters.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.

Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.

Known bugs

   None.
