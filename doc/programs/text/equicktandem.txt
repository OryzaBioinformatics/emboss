                             Program equicktandem
                                       
Function

   Finds tandem repeats
   
Description

   equicktandem scans a sequence for potential tandem repeats up to a
   specified size. The results can be used to run etandem on the
   candidate repeat lengths to identify genuine tandem repeats.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with equicktandem. The input sequence is the
   human herpesvirus tandem repeat.

% equicktandem
Input sequence: embl:hhtetra
Output file [hhtetra.qtan]:
Maximum repeat size [600]:
Threshold score [20]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          sequence   Sequence USA
  [-outfile]           outfile    Output file name
   -maxrepeat          integer    Maximum repeat size
   -threshold          integer    Threshold score

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   
   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence USA Readable sequence Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 2) Output file name Output file <sequence>.equicktandem
   -maxrepeat Maximum repeat size Any integer value 600
   -threshold Threshold score Any integer value 20
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

   The input for equicktandem is a nucleotide sequence
   
Output file format

   The output from equicktandem is an uncommented list of identified
   repeats. In a future version this will change to be annotated sequence
   features.
   
   The columns of the report show:
    1. Score
    2. Start base position
    3. End base position
    4. Repeat size
    5. Repeat count
