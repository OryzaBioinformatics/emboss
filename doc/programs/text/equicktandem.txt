                             Program equicktandem
                                       
Function

   Finds tandem repeats
   
Description

   equicktandem scans a sequence for potential tandem repeats up to a
   specified size. The results can be used to run etandem on the
   candidate repeat lengths to identify genuine tandem repeats.
   
   equicktandem is a simple program that looks for segments in which each
   base tends to match the base back, i.e. with an autocorrelation peak
   at . This can allow drift in the repeating sequence, i.e. it does not
   look for a consensus sequence for the whole repeat block (that is what
   etandem does). But it is much quicker than etandem. It does not
   account for gaps.
   
   The score is +1 for a match to the corresponding base back and -1 for
   a mismatch.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with equicktandem. The input sequence is the
   human herpesvirus tandem repeat.

Input file format

   The input for equicktandem is a nucleotide sequence
   
Output file format

   The output from equicktandem is an uncommented list of identified
   repeats. In a future version this will change to be annotated sequence
   features.
   
   The columns of the report show:
    1. Score
    2. Start base position
    3. End base position
    4. Repeat size
    5. Repeat count

   einverted    Finds DNA inverted repeats

   equicktandem identifies regions wich are likely to contain tanden
   repeats. tandem should then be run on those regions to confirm them
   and to get an accurate specification of the repeats. tandem runs
   slowly.
