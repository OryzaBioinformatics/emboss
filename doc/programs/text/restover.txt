                               Program restover
                                       
Function

   Finds restriction enzymes that produce a specific overhang
   
Description

   The Restriction Enzyme database (REBASE) is a collection of
   information about restriction enzymes and related proteins. It
   contains published and unpublished references, recognition and
   cleavage sites, isoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation
   sensitivity, crystal and sequence data. DNA methyltransferases, homing
   endonucleases, nicking enzymes, specificity subunits and control
   proteins are also included. Most recently, putative DNA
   methyltransferases and restriction enzymes, as predicted from analysis
   of genomic sequences, are also listed.
   
   The home page of REBASE is: http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html
   
   restover takes a specified sequence and a short sequence of a cut-site
   overhang and searches the REBASE database for matching enzymes that
   create the desired overhang sequence when they cut the input sequence.

   The output from restover is a simple text one. The base number,
   restriction enzyme name, recognition site and cut positions are shown.
   Note that cuts are always to the right of the residue shown and that
   5' cuts are referred to by their associated 3' number sequence. The
   program reports enzymes that cut at two or four sites.
   
Data files

   The data files are stored in the REBASE directory of the standard
   EMBOSS data directory. The names are:
   
     * embossre.enz Cleavage information
     * embossre.ref Reference/methylation information
     * embossre.sup Supplier information
       
   The column information is described at the top of the data files
   
Notes

   The data files must have been created before running this program.
   This is done by running the rebaseextract program with the "withrefm"
   file from an REBASE release. You may have to ask your system manager
   to do this.
