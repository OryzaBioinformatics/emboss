                                Program plotorf
                                       
Function

   Plot potential open reading frames
   
Description

   Plot potential open reading frames.
   
   A graphical representation of where the open reading frames are in all
   6 reading frames is shown. The ORFs are displayed as blue boxes.
   
   ORFs in this program are defined as being regions between START and
   STOP codons.
   
   Note that this definition of an ORF would miss those exons in
   eukaryotic genomic sequences which do not contain a START codon.
   plotorf is only really useful when dealing with prokaryotic or mRNA
   eukaryotic sequences.
   
   The default START codon is: "ATG".
   The default STOP codons are: "TAA,TAG,TGA".
   
   You can specify your own set of start and stop codons using the -start
   and -stop qualifiers.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with plotorf.
   
% plotorf
Plot potential open reading frames
Input sequence: embl:paamir

   An example of specifying your own START and STOP codons with a
   mitochondrial sequence would be:
   
% plotorf -start ATT,ATC,ATA,ATG,GTG -stop TAA,TAG,AGA,AGG
Plot potential open reading frames
Input sequence: mito.seq
Graph type [x11]:
