Description

   ontogetobsolete displays on-screen for a named ontology all term
   statement(s) that are obsolete. The information may be written to an
   output file in various formats.

   Ontologies from the EMBOSS data directory are used.

Input file format

  Input files for usage example

  Database entry: edam:alignment

[Term]
id: EDAM:0000083
name: Alignment
namespace: topic
def: Study concerning the alignment (equivalence between sites) of molecular seq
uences, structures or profiles (representing a sequence or structure alignment).
subset: topic
is_obsolete: true
consider: EDAM:0000182 ! Sequence alignment
consider: EDAM:0000183 ! Structure alignment
consider: EDAM:0000184 ! Threading

[Term]
id: EDAM:0002928
name: Alignment
namespace: operation
def: Compare two or more entities, typically the sequence or structure (or deriv
atives) of macromolecules, to identify equivalent subunits.
subset: operation
is_a: EDAM:0000004 ! Operation
is_a: EDAM:0002951 ! Alignment processing
relationship: has_output EDAM:0001916 ! Alignment {minCardinality=1}

[Term]
id: EDAM:0001916
name: Alignment
namespace: data
def: An alignment of molecular sequences, structures or profiles derived from th
em.
subset: data
is_a: EDAM:0002539 ! Alignment data


Output file format

   The default behaviour is to report the entire OBO term statement from
   the ontology. Optionally, then only the the term id, name and
   namespace, or just the term id will be reported.

   The output file by default is in OBO plain text format as used by the
   ontologies in the EMBOSS data directory and explained at
   http://www.geneontology.org/GO.format.obo-1_2.shtml.

   Optionally, the output can be in HTML, OBO-XML or JSON format.

  Output files for usage example

  File: 0000083.obo

[Term]
id: EDAM:0000083
name: Alignment
namespace: topic
def: Study concerning the alignment (equivalence between sites) of molecular seq
uences, structures or profiles (representing a sequence or structure alignment).
subset: topic
is_obsolete: true
consider: EDAM:0000182 ! Sequence alignment
consider: EDAM:0000183 ! Structure alignment
consider: EDAM:0000184 ! Threading


Data files

   OBO-format ontologies must be installed in the EMBOSS data directory
   and indexed. This is done automatically for typical installations.
