Input file format

  Input files for usage example

  Database entry: edam:alignment

[Term]
id: EDAM_data:1916
name: Alignment
namespace: data
def: An alignment of molecular sequences, structures or profiles derived from th
em.
subset: bioinformatics
subset: data
subset: edam
created_in: "beta12orEarlier"
is_a: EDAM_data:3031 ! Core data

[Term]
id: EDAM_topic:0083
name: Alignment
namespace: topic
def: Topic concerning the alignment (equivalence between sites) of molecular seq
uences, structures or profiles (representing a sequence or structure alignment).
subset: bioinformatics
subset: edam
subset: topics
created_in: "beta12orEarlier"
obsolete_since: "beta12orEarlier"
is_obsolete: true
consider: EDAM_topic:0182 ! Sequence alignment
consider: EDAM_topic:0183 ! Structure alignment
consider: EDAM_topic:0184 ! Threading


Output file format

   The default behaviour is to report the entire OBO term statement from
   the ontology. Optionally, then only the the term id, name and
   namespace, or just the term id will be reported.

   The output file by default is in OBO plain text format as used by the
   ontologies in the EMBOSS data directory and explained at
   http://www.geneontology.org/GO.format.obo-1_2.shtml.

   Optionally, the output can be in HTML, OBO-XML or JSON format.

  Output files for usage example

  File: 1916.obo

[Term]
id: EDAM_topic:0083
name: Alignment
namespace: topic
def: Topic concerning the alignment (equivalence between sites) of molecular seq
uences, structures or profiles (representing a sequence or structure alignment).
subset: bioinformatics
subset: edam
subset: topics
created_in: "beta12orEarlier"
obsolete_since: "beta12orEarlier"
is_obsolete: true
consider: EDAM_topic:0182 ! Sequence alignment
consider: EDAM_topic:0183 ! Structure alignment
consider: EDAM_topic:0184 ! Threading


Data files

   OBO-format ontologies must be installed in the EMBOSS data directory
   and indexed. This is done automatically for typical installations.
