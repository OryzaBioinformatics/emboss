Input file format

  Input files for usage example

  Database entry: edam:1234

[Term]
id: EDAM_data:1234
name: Sequence set (nucleic acid)
namespace: data
def: Any collection of multiple nucleotide sequences and associated metadata tha
t do not (typically) correspond to common sequence database records or database
entries.
subset: data
is_a: EDAM_data:0850 ! Sequence set
is_a: EDAM_data:2977 ! Nucleic acid sequence


Output file format

   The default behaviour is to report the entire OBO term statement from
   the ontology. Optionally, then only the the term id, name and
   namespace, or just the term id will be reported.

   The output file by default is in OBO plain text format as used by the
   ontologies in the EMBOSS data directory and explained at
   http://www.geneontology.org/GO.format.obo-1_2.shtml.

   Optionally, the output can be in HTML, OBO-XML or JSON format.

Data files

   OBO-format ontologies must be installed in the EMBOSS data directory
   and indexed. This is done automatically for typical installations.
