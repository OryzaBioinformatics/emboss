Function

   Display a sequence with features, translation etc
   
Description

   showseq displays a protein or a nucleic acid sequence in a style
   suitable for publication.
   
   The output is sent to the screen by default for the user to view, but
   it can write the results to a file.
   
   The display style of the output is very flexible. The user can select
   a style from the pre-set choice of formats, or can design a style to
   suit their purposes and aesthetic tastes.
   
   The displayed sequence can be numbered either by numbering the start
   and ending positions, or by placing a ruler with ticks above or below
   the sequence.
   
   The width of a line can be set. The width of a margin around the
   sequence reserved for numbering can be set. The initial position to
   start numbering from can be set.
   
   The sequence can be translated, using the selectable genetic code
   tables. The translation can be done in one, three or six frames. The
   translation can be displayed in one-letter or three-letter amino acid
   codes. The translation can optionally be displayed only when it is in
   open reading frames (ORFs) of a specified minimum size. One or more
   specified regions of the sequence can be individually translated.
   
   Specified regions of the sequence can be displayed in uppercase to
   highlight them.
   
   The output can be formatted for HTML.
   
   If the output is being formatted for HTML, then specified regions of
   the sequence can be displayed in any valid HTML colours.
   
   The Restriction Enzyme database (REBASE) is a collection of
   information about restriction enzymes and related proteins. It
   contains published and unpublished references, recognition and
   cleavage sites, isoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation
   sensitivity, crystal and sequence data. DNA methyltransferases, homing
   endonucleases, nicking enzymes, specificity subunits and control
   proteins are also included. Most recently, putative DNA
   methyltransferases and restriction enzymes, as predicted from analysis
   of genomic sequences, are also listed.
   
   The home page of REBASE is: http://rebase.neb.com/
   
   This program can use REBASE data to find the recognition sites and/or
   cut sites of restriction enzymes in a nucleic acid sequence.
   
   This program can display the cut sites on both strands.
   
   One potentially very useful option is '-flatreformat' that displays
   not only the cut sites which many other restriction cut-site programs
   will show, but also shows the recognition site.
   
   If the sequence is in EMBL, Genbank or SwissProt format, the feature
   table of the sequence can be dispalyed with the sequence. GFF file
   features can also be displayed if they are included on the command
   line with the -ufo=file qualifier.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with showseq. By default the output appears
   on standard output (the terminal) but can be saved to a file. We only
   look at a small section of the sequence to save space.

   Note that although we asked for the sequence display to end at
   position '100', it has displayed the sequence up to the end of the
   line - position '120'. This is a feature of this program to make the
   display of things like restriction enzyme cutting sites easier.
   
   The standard list of output formats are only a small selection of the
   possible ways in which a sequence might be displayed. Precise control
   over the output format is acheived by selecting the qualifier '-format
   0' (Option 0 in the list of things to display). For example:
   
% showseq tembl:eclac -sbeg 1 -send 120
Display a sequence with features, translation etc..

   By choosing format '0' and then specifying that we want to display the
   things: 'b,s,t,c', we will output the sequence in the following way:
   
   For every new line that the sequence starts to write, the output
   display will contain first a blank line ('b'), then the sequence
   itself ('s') then a line of with ticks every 10 characters ('t') then
   the reverse complement of the sequence ('c'). Subsequent lines of the
   sequence output will repeat this format.
   
   The 'thing' codes used in the list of standard formats are:
   
Sequence only:                  S A
Default sequence:               B N T S A F

   Optional qualifiers:
   -translate          range      Regions to translate (if translating).
                                  If this is left blank the complete sequence
                                  is translated.
                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of
                                  pairs of positions.
                                  The positions are integers.
                                  They are separated by any non-digit,
                                  non-alpha character.
                                  Examples of region specifications are:
                                  24-45, 56-78
                                  1:45, 67=99;765..888
                                  1,5,8,10,23,45,57,99
   -uppercase          range      Regions to put in uppercase.
                                  If this is left blank, then the sequence
                                  case is left alone.
                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of
                                  pairs of positions.
                                  The positions are integers.
                                  They are separated by any non-digit,
                                  non-alpha character.
                                  Examples of region specifications are:

   -highlight          range      Regions to colour if formatting for HTML.
                                  If this is left blank, then the sequence is
                                  left alone.
                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of
                                  pairs of positions.
                                  The positions are integers.
                                  They are followed by any valid HTML font
                                  colour.
                                  Examples of region specifications are:
                                  24-45 blue 56-78 orange
                                  1-100 green 120-156 red
                                  A file of ranges to colour (one range per
                                  line) can be specified as '@filename'.
   -annotation         range      Regions to annotate by marking.
                                  If this is left blank, then no annotation is
                                  added.
                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of

                                  between then, such as:
                                  'HincII,hinfI,ppiI,hindiii'.
                                  The case of the names is not important. You
                                  can specify a file of enzyme names to read
                                  in by giving the name of the file holding
                                  the enzyme names with a '@' character in
                                  front of it, for example, '@enz.list'.
                                  Blank lines and lines starting with a hash
                                  character or '!' are ignored and all other

                                  of enzymes to search for.
                                  An example of a file of enzyme names is:

                                  feature table, a 'CDS' type of feature may
                                  have the tags '/codon', '/codon_start',

                                  '/usedin'. Some of these tags also have
                                  values, for example '/gene' can have the
                                  value of the gene name.
                                  By default any feature tag in the feature
                                  table is shown. You can set this to match
                                  any feature tag you wish to show.
                                  The tag may be wildcarded by using '*'.
                                  If you wish to show more than one tag,
                                  separate their names with the character '|',
                                  eg:

   -matchvalue         string     Tag values are the values associated with a
                                  feature tag. Tags are the types of extra
                                  values that a feature may have. For example
                                  in the EMBL feature table, a 'CDS' type of
                                  feature may have the tags '/codon',

                                  these tags can have values, for example
                                  '/gene' can have the value of the gene name.
                                  By default any feature tag value in the
                                  feature table is shown. You can set this to
                                  match any feature tag valueyou wish to show.
                                  The tag value may be wildcarded by using
                                  '*'.
                                  If you wish to show more than one tag value,
                                  separate their names with the character
                                  '|', eg:

Input file format

   You can specifiy a file of ranges to display in uppercase by giving
   the '-uppercase' qualifier the value '@' followed by the name of the
   file containing the ranges. (eg: '-upper @myfile').
   
   The format of the range file is:
   
     * Comment lines start with '#' in the first column.
     * Comment lines and blank lines are ignored.
     * The line may start with white-space.
     * There are two positive (integer) numbers per line separated by one
       or more space or
     * TAB characters.
     * The second number must be greater or equal to the first number.
     * There can be optional text after the two numbers to annotate the
       line.
     * White-space before or after the text is removed.
       
   An example range file is:
   

# this is my set of ranges
12   23
 4   5       this is like 12-23, but smaller
67   10348   interesting region

   You can specifiy a file of ranges to highlight in a different colour
   when outputting in HTML format (using the '-html' qualifier) by giving
   the '-highlight' qualifier the value '@' followed by the name of the
   file containing the ranges. (eg: '-highlight @myfile').
   
   The format of this file is very similar to the format of the above
   uppercase range file, except that the text after the start and end
   positions is used as the HTML colour name. This colour name is used
   'as is' when specifying the colour in HTML in a '' construct, (where
   'xxx' is the name of the colour).
   
   The standard names of HTML font colours are given in:
   http://http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html and
   http://www.ausmall.com.au/freegraf/ncolour2.htm and
   http://mindprod.com/htmlcolours.html (amongst other places).
   
   An example highlight range file is:
   

# this is my set of ranges
12   23         red
 4   5          darkturquoise
67   10348      #FFE4E1

   You can specifiy a file of ranges to annotate by giving the
   '-annotate' qualifier the value '@' followed by the name of the file
   containing the ranges. (eg: '-annotate @myfile').
   
   The format of this file is very similar to the format of the above
   highlight range file, except that the text after the start and end
   positions is used as the displayed text of the annotated region.
   
   An example annotation range file is:
   
# this is my set of ranges
12   23         exon 1
 4   5          CAP site
67   10348      exon 2

   You can specify a file of enzyme names to read in by giving the
   '-enzymes' qualifier the name of the file holding the enzyme names
   with a '@' character in front of it, for example, '@enz.list'.
   
   Blank lines and lines starting with a '#' or '!' character are ignored
   and all other lines are concatenated together with a comma character
   ',' and then treated as the list of enzymes to search for.
   
   An example of a file of enzyme names is:
   

# my enzymes
HincII, ppiI
# other enzymes
hindiii
HinfI

Output file format

   Most of the variants of the output format have already been described
   in the 'Description' and 'Usage' sections, but here is some more just
   to fill out this section ;-)
   
   The output format is extremely variable and under the control of the
   qualifiers used.
   
   The sequence can be formatted for HTML display by using the '-html'
   qualifier. The top and tail html tags <HEAD>, <BODY> etc. are not
   included as it is expected that the output of this program will be
   included in a more extensive HTML page and so these parts are left to
   the user to provide.
   
   The name of the sequence is displayed, followed by the description of
   the sequence. These can be turned off with the '-noname' and
   '-nodescription' qualifiers.
   
   Then the sequence is output, one line at a time. Any associated
   information to be displayed is also output above and below the
   sequence line, as specified by the '-format' and or '-things'
   qualifiers. (See the 'Description' section for detals).
   
   The margins around the sequence are specified by the use of the
   '-margin' qaulifier and any numbering of the sequence and its
   translations are placed in the margin.
   
   A display of the restriction enzyme cut sites can be selected via
   '-format 6' option or the '-format 0 -thing b,r,s,-r' style of
   options.
   
   The option '-format 7' will produce a formatted display of cut sites
   on the sequence, with the six-frame translation below it. The cut
   sites are indicated by a slash character '\' that points to the
   poition between the nucleotides where the cuts occur. Cuts by many
   enzymes at the same position are indicated by stacking the enzyme
   names on top of each other.
   
   At the end the section header 'Enzymes that cut' is displayed followed
   by a list of the enzymes that cut the specified sequence and the
   number of times that they cut.
   
   The '-flatreformat' qualifier changes the display to emphasise the
   recognition site of the restriction enzyme, which is indicated by a
   row of '=' characters. The cut site if pointed to by a '>' or '<'
   character and if the cut site is not within or imemdiately adjacent to
   the recognition site, they are linked by a row or '.' characters.
   
   The name of the enzyme is displayed above (or below when the reverse
   sense site if displayed) the recognition site. The name of the enzyme
   is also displayed above the cut site if this occurs on a different
   display line to the recognition site (i.e. if it wraps onto the next
   line of sequence).
   
   An example of this display follows:
   
% showseq tembl:eclac stdout -send 60 -format 7 -enz TaqI,Hin6I,AciI,Hin6I,BssK
I,Bsu6

Data files

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
   
      . (your current directory)
      .embossdata (under your current directory)
      ~/ (your home directory)
      ~/.embossdata

   The Genetic Code data files are based on the NCBI genetic code tables.
   Their names and descriptions are:
   

EGC.0      Standard (Differs from GC.1 in that it only has initiation site 'AUG
')
EGC.1      Standard
EGC.2      Vertebrate Mitochondrial
EGC.3      Yeast Mitochondrial
EGC.4      Mold, Protozoan, Coelenterate Mitochondrial and Mycoplasma/Spiroplas
ma
EGC.5      Invertebrate Mitochondrial
EGC.6      Ciliate Macronuclear and Dasycladacean
EGC.9      Echinoderm Mitochondrial
EGC.10     Euplotid Nuclear
EGC.11     Bacterial
EGC.12     Alternative Yeast Nuclear
EGC.13     Ascidian Mitochondrial
EGC.14     Flatworm Mitochondrial
EGC.15     Blepharisma Macronuclear

   The format of these files is very simple.
   
   It consists of several lines of optional comments, each starting with
   a '#' character.
   
   These are followed the line: 'Genetic Code [n]', where 'n' is the
   number of the genetic code file.
   
   This is followed by the description of the code and then by four lines
   giving the IUPAC one-letter code of the translated amino acid, the
   start codons (indicdated by an 'M') and the three bases of the codon,
   lined up one on top of the other.
   
   For example:
   
# Genetic Code Table
#
# Obtained from: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/collab/FT/genetic_codes.html
# and: http://www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Taxonomy/wprintgc?mode=c
#
# Differs from Genetic Code [1] only in that the initiation sites have been
# changed to only 'AUG'

   showseq uses the EMBOSS REBASE data files in 'data/REBASE/*' under the
   EMBOSS installation directory.
   
   These files must first be set up using the program 'rebaseextract'.
   Running 'rebaseextract' may be the job of your system manager.

Known bugs

   None known.
   
   If you ask for the sequence display to end at position '100', with the
   qualifier '-send 100', it will display the sequence up to the end of
   the line - position '120'. This is a feature of this program to make
   the display of things like restriction enzyme cutting sites easier.
   
   It is not a bug. Please don't report it.
