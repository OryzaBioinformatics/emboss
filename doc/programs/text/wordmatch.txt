                               Program wordmatch
                                       
Function

   Finds all exact matches of a given size between 2 sequences
   
Description

   Finds all exact matches of a given minimum size between 2 sequences
   displaying the start points in each sequence and the match length.
   
   This program takes two sequences and finds regions where they are
   identical. These regions are reported in the output file (and
   optionally) in GFF (Gene Feature Format) files.
   
   It will not find identical regions smaller than the specified
   wordsize.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with wordmatch.

% wordmatch sw:hba_human sw:hbb_human
Output file [hba_human.wordmatch]:
Word size [4]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-asequence]         sequence   Sequence USA
  [-bsequence]         sequence   Sequence USA
  [-outfile]           outfile    Output file name
   -wordsize           integer    Word size

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -afeatout           featout    File for output of normal tab delimted gff's
   -bfeatout           featout    File for output of normal tab delimted gff's

   General qualifiers:
  -help                bool       report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-asequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence USA Readable sequence Required
   [-bsequence]
   (Parameter 2) Sequence USA Readable sequence Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 3) Output file name Output file <sequence>.wordmatch
   -wordsize Word size Integer 2 or more 4
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -afeatout File for output of normal tab delimted gff's Writeable
   feature table unknown.gff
   -bfeatout File for output of normal tab delimted gff's Writeable
   feature table unknown.gff
   
Input file format

   Any two sequence USAs of the same type (DNA or protein).
   
Output file format

   The file produced in the above example is:
     _________________________________________________________________
   
FINALLY length = 3
 HBA_HUMAN  HBB_HUMAN Length
        58          63          5
        14          15          4
       116         121          4
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   The first line ('FINALLY...') gives the number of regions found.
   
   The next line gives the headers for the subsequent columns of data.
   This consists for the names of the two sequence and the word 'Length'.
   
   Subsequent lines consist of three columns fo numbers separated by
   spaces or TAB characters. Each line contains the information on one
   identical region. The first column is the start position in the first
   sequence of the identical region. The second number is the start
   position in the second sequence. the third number is the length of the
   identical region.
   
   If no regions are found, the output file is blank.
