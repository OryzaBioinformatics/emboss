Function

   Finds all exact matches of a given size between 2 sequences
   
Description

   Finds all exact matches of a given minimum size between 2 sequences
   displaying the start points in each sequence and the match length.
   
   This program takes two sequences and finds regions where they are
   identical. These regions are reported in the output file (and
   optionally) in GFF (Gene Feature Format) files.
   
   It will not find identical regions smaller than the specified
   wordsize.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with wordmatch.
   
% wordmatch tsw:hba_human tsw:hbb_human
Finds all exact matches of a given size between 2 sequences
Word size [4]:
Output alignment [hba_human.wordmatch]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-asequence]         sequence   Sequence USA
  [-bsequence]         sequence   Sequence USA
   -wordsize           integer    Word size
  [-outfile]           align      Output alignment file name

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -afeatout           featout    File for output of normal tab delimited GFF
                                  features
   -bfeatout           featout    File for output of normal tab delimited GFF
                                  features

   General qualifiers:
  -help                boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-asequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence USA Readable sequence Required
   [-bsequence]
   (Parameter 2) Sequence USA Readable sequence Required
   -wordsize Word size Integer 2 or more 4
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 3) Output alignment file name Alignment file
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -afeatout File for output of normal tab delimited GFF features
   Writeable feature table unknown.gff
   -bfeatout File for output of normal tab delimited GFF features
   Writeable feature table unknown.gff
   
Input file format

   Any two sequence USAs of the same type (DNA or protein).
   
Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS alignment file.
   
   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -aformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. Some of the alignment formats can cope
   with an unlimited number of sequences, while others are only for pairs
   of sequences.
   
   The available multiple alignment format names are: unknown, multiple,
   simple, fasta, msf, trace, srs
   
   The available pairwise alignment format names are: pair, markx0,
   markx1, markx2, markx3, markx10, srspair, score
   
   See: http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Themes/AlignFormats.html
   for further information on alignment formats.
   
   The file produced in the above example is:

   The normal 'report' header is output. It contains the details of the
   program run and the input sequences.
   
   The data lines consist of five columns separated by spaces or TAB
   characters. Each line contains the information on one identical
   region. The first column is the length of the match. The second column
   is the name of the first sequence. The third column is the start and
   end position of the match. The next two columns are the name and
   positions of the second sequence.
