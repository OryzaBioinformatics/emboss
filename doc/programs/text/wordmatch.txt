Function

   Finds all exact matches of a given size between 2 sequences
   
Description

   Finds all exact matches of a given minimum size between 2 sequences
   displaying the start points in each sequence and the match length.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with wordmatch.

% wordmatch sw:hba_human sw:hbb_human
Output file [hba_human.wordmatch]:
Word size [4]:

% more hba_human.wordmatch
FINALLY length = 3
 HBA_HUMAN  HBB_HUMAN Length
        58          63          5
        14          15          4
       116         121          4
