Function

   Index a fasta file database

Description

   dbifasta indexes a flat file database of one or more files, and builds
   EMBL CD-ROM format index files. This format is used by the software on
   the EMBL database CD-ROM distribution and by the Staden package in
   addition to EMBOSS, and appears to be the most generally used and
   publicly available index file format for these databases.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with dbifasta


% dbifasta
Index a fasta file database
Database name: EMROD
              simple : >ID
               idacc : >ID ACC
  or >ID (ACC) gcgid : >db:ID
            gcgidacc : >db:ID ACC
                dbid : >db ID
                ncbi : | formats
ID line format [idacc]: idacc
Database directory [.]: data
Wildcard database filename [*.dat]: emrod
Release number [0.0]:
Index date [00/00/00]:
General log output file [outfile.dbifasta]:

Total 1 files 6 entries (0 duplicates)

   dbifasta creates four index files. All are binary but with a simple
   format.

     * division.lkp is the master index file, and has a 300 byte header
       containing the database name and date plus information on the
       record size. This header is followed by one record for each
       database file, giving the full file name for the data file, and
       optionally a second sequence file.
     * entryname.idx is the entry name index. It has the same 300 byte
       header, mainly used to store the record size which will depend on
       the size of the longest entryname in the database. Each entry is
       stored in sorted alphanumeric order so that a binary search can be
       used to efficiently find any record. The record also holds the file
       number from division.lkp and the offsets in the data and sequence
       files for that entry.
     * acnum.trg holds the accession number information. The file has the
       usual 300 byte header, and a sorted list of record by accession
       number. Each accession number record contains the first record
       number in acnum.hit and the total number of records in acnum.hit so
       that secondary (duplicated) accession numbers can be searched.
     * acnum.hit is a very simple file. After the usual 300 byte header,
       each record simply holds the record number in entryname.idx. An
       accession number search will use acnum.trg to find a start position
       and number of records to read in this file, and will then simply
       read the entryname.idx records for each entry in turn.

Data files

   None.

Notes

   The indexing method depends on each entry having a unique entry name.
   No allowance is made for two entries with the same name so it is not
   possible to index EMBL and EMBLNEW together.

   Having created the EMBOSS indices for this file, a database can then be
   defined in the file emboss.defaults as something like:
DB emrod [
   type: N
   format: fasta
   method: emblcd
   directory: /data/embl/fasta
]

  Fields Indexed

   By default, dbifasta will index the ID name and the accession number
   (if present).
   If they are present in your database, you may also specify that
   dbifasta should index the Sequence Version and GI number and the words
   in the description by using the '-fields' qualifier with the
   appropriate values.
