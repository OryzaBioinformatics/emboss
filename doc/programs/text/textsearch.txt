Function

   Search sequence documentation text. SRS and Entrez are faster!
   
Description

   This is a small utility search for words in the description text of a
   sequence and for each match list the sequence's name and/or
   description. NB. It only searches the description line of the
   annotation, not the full annotation.
   
Usage

   Search for matches to 'lacZ'
% textsearch swissprot:\*  'lacz'

   Search for matches to 'lacz' or 'permease' in E.coli proteins
% textsearch swissprot:\*_ecoli 'lacZ | permease'

   Output a search for 'transport' formatted with HTML to a file
% textsearch embl:\* 'transport' -html -outfile embl.transport

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
  [-pattern]           string     The search pattern is a regular expression.
                                  Use a | to indicate OR.
                                  For example:
                                  human|mouse
                                  will find text with either 'human' OR
                                  'mouse' in the text

   Optional qualifiers:
   -outfile            outfile    If you enter the name of a file here then
                                  this program will write the sequence details
                                  into that file.
   -html               bool       Format output as an HTML table
   -casesensitive      bool       Do a case-sensitive search

   Advanced qualifiers:
   -only               bool       This is a way of shortening the command line
                                  if you only want a few things to be
                                  displayed. Instead of specifying:
                                  '-nohead -noname -nousa -noacc -nodesc'
                                  to get only the name output, you can specify
                                  '-only -name'
   -heading            bool       Display column headings
   -usa                bool       Display the USA of the sequence
   -accession          bool       Display 'accession' column
   -name               bool       Display 'name' column
   -description        bool       Display 'description' column


   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   [-pattern]
   (Parameter 2) The search pattern is a regular expression. Use a | to
   indicate OR. For example: human|mouse will find text with either
   'human' OR 'mouse' in the text Any string is accepted An empty string
   is accepted
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -outfile If you enter the name of a file here then this program will
   write the sequence details into that file. Output file stdout
   -html Format output as an HTML table Yes/No No
   -casesensitive Do a case-sensitive search Yes/No No
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -only This is a way of shortening the command line if you only want a
   few things to be displayed. Instead of specifying: '-nohead -noname
   -nousa -noacc -nodesc' to get only the name output, you can specify
   '-only -name' Yes/No No
   -heading Display column headings Yes/No @(!$(only))
   -usa Display the USA of the sequence Yes/No @(!$(only))
   -accession Display 'accession' column Yes/No @(!$(only))
   -name Display 'name' column Yes/No @(!$(only))
   -description Display 'description' column Yes/No @(!$(only))
   
Input file format

   Normal sequence
   
Output file format

   The output is displayed on the screen (stdout) by default. A typical
   output file is:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Search for: TRANSPORT
ANSP_SALTY    L-ASPARAGINE PERMEASE (L-ASPARAGINE TRANSPORT PROTEIN).
CYST_SALTY    SULFATE TRANSPORT SYSTEM PERMEASE PROTEIN CYST (FRAGMENT).
HISM_SALTY    HISTIDINE TRANSPORT SYSTEM PERMEASE PROTEIN HISM.
HISQ_SALTY    HISTIDINE TRANSPORT SYSTEM PERMEASE PROTEIN HISQ.
LIVH_SALTY    HIGH-AFFINITY BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID TRANSPORT PERMEASE ...
LIVM_SALTY    HIGH-AFFINITY BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACID TRANSPORT PERMEASE ...
MALF_SALTY    MALTOSE TRANSPORT SYSTEM PERMEASE PROTEIN MALF.
MALG_SALTY    MALTOSE TRANSPORT SYSTEM PERMEASE PROTEIN MALG.
MELB_SALTY    MELIBIOSE CARRIER PROTEIN (THIOMETHYLGALACTOSIDE PERMEASE II) ...
MGLC_SALTY    GALACTOSIDE TRANSPORT SYSTEM PERMEASE PROTEIN MGLC.
OPPB_SALTY    OLIGOPEPTIDE TRANSPORT SYSTEM PERMEASE PROTEIN OPPB.
OPPC_SALTY    OLIGOPEPTIDE TRANSPORT SYSTEM PERMEASE PROTEIN OPPC.
POTB_SALTY    SPERMIDINE/PUTRESCINE TRANSPORT SYSTEM PERMEASE PROTEIN POTB ...
PROW_SALTY    GLYCINE BETAINE/L-PROLINE TRANSPORT SYSTEM PERMEASE PROTEIN ...
SAPB_SALTY    PEPTIDE TRANSPORT SYSTEM PERMEASE PROTEIN SAPB.
SAPC_SALTY    PEPTIDE TRANSPORT SYSTEM PERMEASE PROTEIN SAPC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

   The first column in the name or ID of each sequence. The remaining
   text is the description line of the sequence.
   
   When the -html qualifier is specified, then the output will be wrapped
   in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web page. Note that tags such
   as <HTML>, <BODY>, </BODY> and </HTML> are not output by this program
   as the table of databases is expected to form only part of the
   contents of a web page - the rest of the web page must be supplier by
   the user.
   
   The lines of out information are guaranteed not to have trailing
   white-space at the end. So if '-nodesc' is used, there will not be any
   whitespace after the ID name.
   
Data files

   None.
   
Notes

   This is a rather slow way to search for text in databases. If you are
   searching for text in public databases, you should consider using
   either Entrez (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/) or SRS
   (http://srs.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/ or http://www.sanger.ac.uk/srs6/ etc.)
