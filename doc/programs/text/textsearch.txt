Function

   Search the textual description of sequence(s)

Description

   textsearch searches for words (specified as a regular expression) in
   the description text of one or more input sequences. It writes an
   output file with optional contents such as the name, description and
   accession number of any sequence whose description line from the
   annotation matches the search term. Optionally, the search is
   case-sensitive and the results output as an HTML table. textsearch is
   convenient for small input files but will be slow for larger files and
   databases; you should use use SRS or Entrez instead.

Algorithm

   textsearch searches only the description line, not the full sequence
   annotation.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with textsearch

   Search for 'lactose':


% textsearch 'tsw:*' 'lactose' 
Search the textual description of sequence(s)
Output file [12s1_arath.textsearch]: 

   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 2

   Search for 'lactose' or 'permease' in E.coli proteins:


% textsearch 'tsw:*_ecoli' 'lactose | permease' 
Search the textual description of sequence(s)
Output file [bgal_ecoli.textsearch]: 

   Go to the input files for this example
   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 3

   Output a search for 'lacz' formatted with HTML to a file:


% textsearch 'tembl:*' 'lacz' -html -outfile embl.lacz.html 
Search the textual description of sequence(s)

   Go to the output files for this example

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     (Gapped) sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
  [-pattern]           string     The search pattern is a regular expression.
                                  Use a | to indicate OR.
                                  For example:
                                  human|mouse
                                  will find text with either 'human' OR
                                  'mouse' in the text (Any string is accepted)
  [-outfile]           outfile    [*.textsearch] Output file name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -casesensitive      boolean    [N] Do a case-sensitive search
   -html               boolean    [N] Format output as an HTML table

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -only               boolean    [N] This is a way of shortening the command
                                  line if you only want a few things to be
                                  displayed. Instead of specifying:
                                  '-nohead -noname -nousa -noacc -nodesc'
                                  to get only the name output, you can specify
                                  '-only -name'
   -heading            boolean    [@(!$(only))] Display column headings
   -usa                boolean    [@(!$(only))] Display the USA of the
                                  sequence
   -accession          boolean    [@(!$(only))] Display 'accession' column
   -name               boolean    [@(!$(only))] Display 'name' column

tsw-id:LACY_ECOLI LACY_ECOLI    P02920  Lactose permease (Lactose-proton sympor
t)

  Output files for usage example 3

  File: embl.lacz.html

   Search for: lacz
   tembl-id:J01636 J01636 J01636 E.coli lactose operon with lacI, lacZ,
   lacY and lacA genes.
   tembl-id:V00296 V00296 V00296 E. coli gene lacZ coding for
   beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23).

   The first column in the name or ID of each sequence. The remaining
   text is the description line of the sequence.

   When the -html qualifier is specified, then the output will be wrapped
   in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web page. Note that tags such
   as <HTML>, <BODY>, </BODY> and </HTML> are not output by this program
   as the table of databases is expected to form only part of the
   contents of a web page - the rest of the web page must be supplier by
   the user.

   The lines of out information are guaranteed not to have trailing
   white-space at the end. So if '-nodesc' is used, there will not be any
   whitespace after the ID name.

Data files

   None.

Notes

   This is a rather slow way to search for text in databases. If you are
   searching for text in public databases, you should consider using
   either SRS (http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/) or Entrez (
   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/)
