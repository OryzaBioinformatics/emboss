Function

   Translate nucleic acid sequences
   
Description

   This translate nucleic acid sequences to the corresponding peptide
   sequence.
   
   It can translate in any of the 3 forward or three reverse sense
   frames, or in all three forward or reverse frames, or in all six
   frames.
   
   It can translate specified regions corersponding to the coding regions
   of your sequences.
   
   It can translate using the standard ('Universal') genetic code and
   also with a selection of non-standard codes.
   
   Termination (STOP) codons are translated as the character '*'.
   
   The output peptide sequence is always in the standard one-letter IUPAC
   code.
   
Usage

   To translate a sequence 'pop.seq' in the first frame (starting at the
   first base and proceeding to the end):
% transeq pop.seq pop.pep

   To translate a sequence 'pop.seq' in the second frame:
% transeq pop.seq pop.pep -frame=2

   To translate a sequence 'pop.seq' in the third frame in the reverse
   sense (starting at the last base and proceeding to the start):
% transeq pop.seq pop.pep -frame=-1

   To translate a sequence 'pop.seq' in all three forward frames:
% transeq pop.seq pop.pep -frame=F

   To translate a sequence 'pop.seq' in all three reverse frames:
% transeq pop.seq pop.pep -frame=R

   To translate a sequence 'pop.seq' in all six forward and reverse
   frames:
% transeq pop.seq pop.pep -frame=6

   To translate a specific set of regions corresponding to a known set of
   coding sequences:
% transeq pop.seq pop.pep -reg=2-45,67-201,328-509

   To translate a sequence 'mito.seq' using the mammalian mitochondrion
   genetic code table:
% transeq mito.seq mito.pep -table=2

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
  [-outseq]            seqoutall  Output sequence(s) USA

   Optional qualifiers:
   -frame              list       Frame(s) to translate
   -table              list       Code to use
   -regions            range      Regions to translate.
                                  If this is left blank, then the complete
                                  sequence is translated.
                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of
                                  pairs of positions.
                                  The positions are integers.
                                  They are separated by any non-digit,
                                  non-alpha character.
                                  Examples of region specifications are:
                                  24-45, 56-78
                                  1:45, 67=99;765..888

   -trim               bool       This removes all X and * characters from the
                                  right end of the translation. The trimming
                                  process starts at the end and continues
                                  until the next character is not a X or a *

   -regions Regions to translate. If this is left blank, then the
   complete sequence is translated. A set of regions is specified by a
   set of pairs of positions. The positions are integers. They are
   separated by any non-digit, non-alpha character. Examples of region
   specifications are: 24-45, 56-78 1:45, 67=99;765..888
   1,5,8,10,23,45,57,99 Sequence range Whole sequence
   -trim This removes all X and * characters from the right end of the
   translation. The trimming process starts at the end and continues
   until the next character is not a X or a * Yes/No No

Input file format

   The input sequence can be one or more nucleic acid sequences.
   
Output file format

   One or more peptide sequences are written out.
   
   The names of the resulting protein sequences are formed from the name
   of the input nucleic acid sequence with '_' and the translation frame
   appended to it. Thus a nucleic acid sequence with the name 'XYZ'
   franslated in all 6 frame would produce protein sequences with the
   names: 'XYZ_1', 'XYZ_2', 'XYZ_3', 'XYZ_4', 'XYZ_5', 'XYZ_6'.
   
   For example, the result of the command
   transeq em:hsfau -frame=6
   would be:

   If regions are specified, they are taken to be translated in frame 1
   and so the output name would be 'XYZ_1'.
   
Data files

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
       
   The Genetic Code data files are based on the NCBI genetic code tables.
   Their names and descriptions are:
   
   EGC.0
          Standard (Differs from GC.1 in that it only has initiation site
          'AUG')
          
   EGC.1
          Standard
          
   EGC.2
          Vertebrate Mitochodrial
          
   EGC.3
          Yeast Mitochondrial
          
   EGC.4
          Mold, Protozoan, Coelenterate Mitochondrial and
          Mycoplasma/Spiroplasma
          
   EGC.5
          Invertebrate Mitochondrial
          
   EGC.6
          Ciliate Macronuclear and Dasycladacean
          
   EGC.9
          Echinoderm Mitochondrial
          
   EGC.10
          Euplotid Nuclear
          
   EGC.11
          Bacterial
          
   EGC.12
          Alternative Yeast Nuclear
          
   EGC.13
          Ascidian Mitochondrial
          
   EGC.14
          Flatworm Mitochondrial
          
   EGC.15
          Blepharisma Macronuclear
          
   The format of these files is very simple.
   
   It consists of several lines of optional comments, each starting with
   a '#' character.
   
   These are followed the line: 'Genetic Code [n]', where 'n' is the
   number of the genetic code file.
   
   This is followed by the description of the code and then by four lines
   giving the IUPAC one-letter code of the translated amino acid, the
   start codons (indicdated by an 'M') and the three bases of the codon,
   lined up one on top of the other.
   
   For example:

#
# Differs from Genetic Code [1] only in that the initiation sites have been
# changed to only 'AUG'

Warnings

   When translation using non-standard genetic code table, always check
   the table carefully for deviations from your particular organism's
   code.
   
Diagnostic Error Messages

   Several warning messages about malformed region specifications:
     * Non-digit found in region ...
     * Unpaired start of a region found in ...
     * Non-digit found in region ...
     * The start of a pair of region positions must be smaller than the
       end in ...
       
Exit status

   It exits with status 0, unless a region is badly constructed.
   
Known bugs
