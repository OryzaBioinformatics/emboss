                                Program btwisted
                                       
Function

   Calculates the overall twist and stacking energy of a DNA sequence 
   assuming it is B-DNA.
   
Description

   btwisted takes a region of a pure DNA sequence and calculates by simple 
   arithmetic the probable overall twist of the sequence and the stacking 
   energy.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with btwisted.

% btwisted embl:ab000095 -sbegin 100 -send 120 
calculates the twisting in a B-DNA sequence 
Output file [ab000095.btwisted]:

Output file format

# Output from BTWISTED
# Twisting calculated from 100 to 120 of AB000095
Total twist (degrees): 646.6
Total turns : 1.80
Average bases per turn: 11.69
Total stacking energy : -172.77
Average stacking energy per dinucleotide: -8.64 

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          sequence   Sequence USA
  [-outfile]           outfile    Output file name
 
   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -angledata          infile     file containing base pair twist angles
   -energydata         infile     file containing base pair stacking energies

Input file format

  The data files for btwisted have the following format:

# at the beginning of a line is a comment and is ignored
dinucleotide	float

  No check is made that all dinucleotides have been read for the energy and 
  twist. Attempting to run btwisted with an incomplete data file will result
  a fatal error if the sequence contains a dinucleotide not in the data files. 
         
Exit status

  Returns 0 on success.
