                               Program btwisted
                                       
Function

   Calculates the twisting in a B-DNA sequence
   
Description

   btwisted takes a region of a pure DNA sequence and calculates by
   simple arithmetic the probable overall twist of the sequence and the
   stacking energy.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with btwisted:

% btwisted embl:ab000095 -sbegin 100 -send 120
Calculates the twisting in a B-DNA sequence
Output file [ab000095.btwisted]:

Average stacking energy per dinucleotide: -8.64

Data files

   The program reads in two data files.
   
   The first is prompted for by:
   
   "File containing base pair twist angles"
   
   This is the data file 'Eangles.dat' by default.
   
   This consists of the data:
   
aa      35.6    0.1
ac      34.4    1.3
ag      27.7    1.5
at      31.5    1.1
ca      34.5    0.9
cc      33.7    0.1
cg      29.8    1.1
ct      27.7    1.5
ga      36.9    0.9
gc      40.0    1.2
gg      33.7    0.1
gt      34.4    1.3
ta      36.0    1.0
tc      36.9    0.9
tg      34.5    0.9
tt      35.6    0.1

   The second is prompted for by:
   
   "File containing base pair stacking energies"
   This is the data file 'Eenergy.dat' by default.
   
   This consists of the data:
   
#base pair stacking energy for B-DNA
aa      -5.37
ac      -10.51
ag      -6.78
at      -6.57
ca      -6.57
cc      -8.26
cg      -9.69
ct      -6.78
ga      -9.81
gc      -14.59
gg      -8.26
gt      -10.51
ta      -3.82
tc      -9.81
tg      -6.57
tt      -5.37

   No check is made that all dinucleotides have been read for the energy
   and twist. Attempting to run btwisted with an incomplete data file
   will result a fatal error if the sequence contains a dinucleotide not
   in the data files.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
   
% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
       
Notes

   None.
   
References

   None.
   
Warnings

   No check is made that all dinucleotides have been read for the energy
   and twist. Attempting to run btwisted with an incomplete data file
   will result a fatal error if the sequence contains a dinucleotide not
   in the data files.
   
Diagnostic Error Messages

   "Incomplete table"
   You have supplied data files for either the angles or energies that do
   not contain the fulll required set of possible dinucleotides.
   
Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.
   
Known bugs

   No check is made that all dinucleotides have been read for the energy
   and twist. Attempting to run btwisted with an incomplete data file
   will result a fatal error if the sequence contains a dinucleotide not
   in the data files.
