Function

   Create an ambiguous consensus sequence from a multiple alignment

Description

   cons calculates a consensus sequence from a multiple sequence
   alignment. To obtain the consensus, the amino acid residue or
   nucleotide at each position is compared to the possible ambiguity
   codes. The consensus sequence uses the minimum ambiguity code match.

Algorithm

   The ambiguity codes are defined in local data files. consambig uses
   these files to determine which codes match all residues or nucleotides
   in the input sequences at each position.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with consambig


% consambig
Create an ambiguous consensus sequence from a multiple alignment
Input (aligned) sequence set: dna.msf
output sequence [dna.fasta]: aligned.consambig

Data files

   consambig uses the standard files Ebases.iub and Eresidues.iub in the
   EMBOSS data directory.

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat


   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata". Files
   for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or again
   in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
