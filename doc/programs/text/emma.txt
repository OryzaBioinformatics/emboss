Function

   Multiple alignment program - interface to ClustalW program
   
Description

   EMMA calculates the multiple alignment of nucleic acid or protein
   sequences according to the method of Thompson, J.D., Higgins, D.G. and
   Gibson, T.J. (1994).
   
   This is an interface to the ClustalW distribution.

Input file format

   The input is two or more sequences.
   
Output file format

   emma writes the aligned sequences and a dendrogram file showing how
   the sequences were clusterd during the progressive alignments.
   
   The clustalw output sequeces are reformatted into EMBOSS output.
