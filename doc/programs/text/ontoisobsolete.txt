  Input files for usage example 2

  Database entry: edam:0575

Output file format

   A single line per term is is given, including the term id, namespace
   and name, and whether it is obsolete or not.

Data files

   OBO-format ontologies must be installed in the EMBOSS data directory
   and indexed. This is done automatically for typical installations.
