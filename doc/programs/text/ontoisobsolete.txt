Function

   Get ontology term(s)

Description

   ontoget displays on-screen for a named ontology whether term
   statement(s) with the supplied IDs are obsolete or not. The information
   may be written to an output file in various formats.

   Ontologies from the EMBOSS data directory are used.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with ontoget


% ontoget edam:0001234
Get ontology term(s)

Command line arguments

Get ontology term(s)
Version: EMBOSS:6.4.0.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-oboterms]          obo        Obo term filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input query)
  [-outfile]           outobo     [*.ontoget] Output ontology term file name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -subclasses         boolean    [N] Extend the query matches to include all

   -obsolete           boolean    [N] The default behaviour is to not use or
                                  return obsolete terms. This option if set
                                  will include all terms.

Data files

   OBO-format ontologies must be installed in the EMBOSS data directory
   and indexed. This is done automatically for typical installations.
