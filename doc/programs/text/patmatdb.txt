Function

   Search a protein sequence with a motif
   
Description

   Takes a protein motif and compares it to a set of protein sequences.
   
   It returns the number of matches there were between the motif and each
   matched sequence, length of match, start and end positions of match,
   and writes out an alignment.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with patmatdb.
   
% patmatdb
Search a protein sequence with a motif
Input sequence(s): sw:*
Protein motif to search for: st[ty]s
Output file [5h1d_fugru.patmatdb]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
  [-motif]             string     Patterns for patmatdb are based on the
                                  format of pattern used in the PROSITE
                                  database. For example:
                                  '[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C' means two Asps or
                                  Glus in any order followed by His, Ser, any
                                  residue other then Pro, then two of any
                                  residue followed by Pro followed by two to
                                  four of any residue followed by Cys. The
                                  search is case-independent, so 'AAA' matches
                                  'aaa'.

                                  information on associated and general

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   [-motif]
   (Parameter 2) Patterns for patmatdb are based on the format of pattern
   used in the PROSITE database. For example: '[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C'
   means two Asps or Glus in any order followed by His, Ser, any residue
   other then Pro, then two of any residue followed by Pro followed by
   two to four of any residue followed by Cys. The search is
   case-independent, so 'AAA' matches 'aaa'. A string of at least 2
   characters Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 3) Output report file name Report file
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default

   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

   It reads in one or more protein sequences.
   
   Patterns for patmatdb are based on the format of pattern used in the
   PROSITE database, with the difference that the terminating dot '.' and
   the hyphens, '-', between the characters are optional.
   
   The PROSITE pattern definition from the PROSITE documentation follows.
     * The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the amino acids are used.
     * The symbol `x' is used for a position where any amino acid is
       accepted.
     * Ambiguities are indicated by listing the acceptable amino acids
       for a given position, between square parentheses `[ ]'. For
       example: [ALT] stands for Ala or Leu or Thr.
     * Ambiguities are also indicated by listing between a pair of curly
       brackets `{ }' the amino acids that are not accepted at a given
       position. For example: {AM} stands for any amino acid except Ala
       and Met.
     * Each element in a pattern is separated from its neighbor by a `-'.
       (Optional in patmatdb).
     * Repetition of an element of the pattern can be indicated by
       following that element with a numerical value or a numerical range
       between parenthesis. Examples: x(3) corresponds to x-x-x, x(2,4)
       corresponds to x-x or x-x-x or x-x-x-x.
     * When a pattern is restricted to either the N- or C-terminal of a
       sequence, that pattern either starts with a `<' symbol or
       respectively ends with a `>' symbol.
     * A period ends the pattern. (Optional in patmatdb).
       
   For example, in SWISSPROT entry 100K_RAT you can look for the pattern:
   
[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C

   This means: Two Asps or Glus in any order followed by His, Ser, any
   residue other then Pro, then two of any residue followed by Pro
   followed by two to four of any residue followed by Cys.
   
   The search is case-independent, so 'AAA' matches 'aaa'.
   
Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS report file.
   
   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -rformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: embl,
   genbank, gff, pir, swiss, trace, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq, excel,
   feattable, motif, regions, seqtable, simple, srs, table, tagseq
   
   See:
   http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Themes/ReportFormats.html for
   further information on report formats.
   
   By default patmatdb writes a 'dbmotif' report file.
   
   The output from the above example follows:

   This does much the same is patmatdb, but has a slightly different
   style of output and allows mismatches.
   
   patmatmotifs - Compares a protein sequence to the PROSITE motif

   This does the opposite to patmatdb, comparing a database of motifs to
   one sequence.
