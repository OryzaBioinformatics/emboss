                               Program patmatdb
                                       
Function

   Search a protein sequence with a motif
   
Description

   Takes a protein motif and compares it to a set of protein sequences.
   
   It returns the number of matches there were between the motif and each
   matched sequence, length of match, start and end positions of match,
   and writes out an alignment.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with patmatdb.
   
% patmatdb
Search a protein sequence with a motif
Input sequence(s): sw:*
Protein motif to search for: st[ty]s
Output file [5h1d_fugru.patmatdb]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
  [-motif]             string     Patterns for patmatdb are based on the
                                  format of pattern used in the PROSITE
                                  database. For example:
                                  '[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C' means two Asps or
                                  Glus in any order followed by His, Ser, any
                                  residue other then Pro, then two of any
                                  residue followed by Pro followed by two to
                                  four of any residue followed by Cys. The
                                  search is case-independent, so 'AAA' matches
                                  'aaa'.
  [-outfile]           outfile    Output file name

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   
   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   [-motif]
   (Parameter 2) Patterns for patmatdb are based on the format of pattern
   used in the PROSITE database. For example: '[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C'
   means two Asps or Glus in any order followed by His, Ser, any residue
   other then Pro, then two of any residue followed by Pro followed by
   two to four of any residue followed by Cys. The search is
   case-independent, so 'AAA' matches 'aaa'. A string of at least 2
   characters Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 3) Output file name Output file <sequence>.patmatdb
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

   It reads in one or more protein sequences.
   
   Patterns for patmatdb are based on the format of pattern used in the
   PROSITE database, with the difference that the terminating dot '.' and
   the hyphens, '-', between the characters are optional.
   
   The PROSITE pattern definition from the PROSITE documentation follows.
     * The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the amino acids are used.
     * The symbol `x' is used for a position where any amino acid is
       accepted.
     * Ambiguities are indicated by listing the acceptable amino acids
       for a given position, between square parentheses `[ ]'. For
       example: [ALT] stands for Ala or Leu or Thr.
     * Ambiguities are also indicated by listing between a pair of curly
       brackets `{ }' the amino acids that are not accepted at a given
       position. For example: {AM} stands for any amino acid except Ala
       and Met.
     * Each element in a pattern is separated from its neighbor by a `-'.
       (Optional in patmatdb).
     * Repetition of an element of the pattern can be indicated by
       following that element with a numerical value or a numerical range
       between parenthesis. Examples: x(3) corresponds to x-x-x, x(2,4)
       corresponds to x-x or x-x-x or x-x-x-x.
     * When a pattern is restricted to either the N- or C-terminal of a
       sequence, that pattern either starts with a `<' symbol or
       respectively ends with a `>' symbol.
     * A period ends the pattern. (Optional in patmatdb).
       
   For example, in SWISSPROT entry 100K_RAT you can look for the pattern:
   
[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C

   This means: Two Asps or Glus in any order followed by His, Ser, any
   residue other then Pro, then two of any residue followed by Pro
   followed by two to four of any residue followed by Cys.
   
   The search is case-independent, so 'AAA' matches 'aaa'.
   
Output file format

   The output from the above example follows:
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Number of matches found in HD_FUGRU = 1

   This does much the same is patmatdb, but has a slightly different

   patmatmotifs - Compares a protein sequence to the PROSITE motif
   database.
   This does the opposite to patmatdb, comparing a database of motifs to
   one sequence.
