Function

   Silent mutation restriction enzyme scan
   
Description

   silent does a scan of a nucleic acid sequence for silent mutation
   restriction enzyme sites.
   
   silent finds positions in a sequence where a point mutation could be
   made to introduce a specified restriction enzyme recognition site
   without changing the translation.
   
   Several restriction enzyme can be specified.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with silent:
   
% silent
Silent mutation restriction enzyme scan
Input sequence: embl:hsfau
Comma separated enzyme list [all]: ecori,hindiii
Output file [hsfau.silent]:

   Program name                          Description
   recoder      Remove restriction sites but maintain the same translation
   redata       Search REBASE for enzyme name, references, suppliers etc
   remap        Display a sequence with restriction cut sites, translation etc
   restover     Finds restriction enzymes that produce a specific overhang
   restrict     Finds restriction enzyme cleavage sites
   showseq      Display a sequence with features, translation etc
   
   silent does the opposite to recode. silent finds sites where a
   restriction enzyme site can be introduced without changing the
   translation in frame 1 of the sequence. recode finds sites where a
   restriction enzyme site can be removed without changing the
   translation in frame 1 of the sequence.
