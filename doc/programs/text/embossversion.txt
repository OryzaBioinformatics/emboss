Input file format

   None.

Output file format

   embossversion writes just the version number followed by a newline
   character to end the line.

   The output is written to the screen by default, but can be written to a
   named file by using the '-outfile' option.

   The version number is in three parts, separated by '.'s.
   The first number is the major version number - this only changes when
   substantial changes have been made to the look-and-feel of EMBOSS.
   The second number is the minor version number - this is incremented
   whenever a version is released.
   The third number is usually '0' but if a minor bug fix has been
   released that does not warrant a minor version number, this will be
   incremented.

Data files

   None.

Notes

   embossversion might be called by scripts in automated systems requiring
   versioning information, or in user-support as a convenient way to
   ascertain the version of an EMBOSS installation being used remotely.

References

   None.

Warnings

   None.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.

Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.

Known bugs

   None.
