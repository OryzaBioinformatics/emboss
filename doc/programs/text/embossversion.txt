Function

   Writes the current EMBOSS version number
   
Description

   This small utility writes out the current version of the EMBOSS
   package.
   
   It is expected that this may have a use in scripts which automatically
   write descriptions of the state of the EMBOSS package that is set up
   locally.
   
   It will also be a useful way for people to ascertain what version is
   being run if they are giving user-support to people in another site.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with embossversion
   

% embossversion 
Writes the current EMBOSS version number

Output file format

   embossversion writes just the version number followed by a newline
   character to end the line.
   
   The output is written to the screen by default, but can be written to
   a named file by using the '-outfile' option.
   
   The version number is in three parts, separated by '.'s.
   The first number is the major version number - this only changes when
   substantial changes have been made to the look-and-feel of EMBOSS.
   The second number is the minor version number - this is incremented
   whenever a version is released.
   The third number is usually '0' but if a minor bug fix has been
   released that does not warrant a minor version number, this will be
   incremented.
