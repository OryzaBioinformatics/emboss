Function

   Wobble base plot
   
Description

   Wobble plots the third position variability as an indicator of a
   potential coding region.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with wobble. The example sequence is from
   Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which has a high G+C content and a very biased
   third codon position (if it can be G or C, it usually is).
