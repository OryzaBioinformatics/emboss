Description

   Here is a sample session with maskfeat.

% maskfeat

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
  [-outseq]            seqout     Output sequence USA

   Optional qualifiers:
   -type               string     By default any feature in the feature table
                                  with a type starting 'repeat' is masked. You
                                  can set this to be any feature type you
                                  wish to mask.
                                  See http://www3.ebi.ac.uk/Services/WebFeat/
                                  for a list of the EMBL feature types and see
                                  Appendix A of the Swissprot user manual in
                                  http://www.expasy.ch/txt/userman.txt for a
                                  list of the Swissprot feature types.
                                  The type may be wildcarded by using '*'.
                                  If you wish to mask more than one type,
                                  separate their names with spaces or commas,
                                  eg:
                                  *UTR repeat*
   -maskchar           string     Character to use when masking.
                                  Default is 'X' for protein sequences, 'N'
                                  for nucleic sequences.

   Advanced qualifiers: (none)

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   [-outseq]
   (Parameter 2) Output sequence USA Writeable sequence <sequence>.format
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -type By default any feature in the feature table with a type starting
   'repeat' is masked. You can set this to be any feature type you wish
   to mask. See http://www3.ebi.ac.uk/Services/WebFeat/ for a list of the
   EMBL feature types and see Appendix A of the Swissprot user manual in
   http://www.expasy.ch/txt/userman.txt for a list of the Swissprot
   feature types. The type may be wildcarded by using '*'. If you wish to
   mask more than one type, separate their names with spaces or commas,
   eg: *UTR repeat* Any string is accepted repeat*
   -maskchar Character to use when masking. Default is 'X' for protein
   sequences, 'N' for nucleic sequences. Any string is accepted 'X' for
   protein, 'N' for nucleic
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
