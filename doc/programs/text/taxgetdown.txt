Function

   Get descendants of taxon(s)

Description

   taxgetdown reads in one or more taxons, finds all taxons below in tyhe
   hierarchy, and writes them out. The taxon input may be a literal
   sequence or read from a database, file, file of taxon names, or even
   the command-line or the output of another programs. The taxon output
   can be written to screen, to file, or passed to another program. A wide
   range of standard taxon formats may be specified for input and output.

Algorithm

   The NCBI taxonomy records the parent of each taxon, up to a known top
   level 1.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with taxgetdown


% taxgetdown ttax:9605 -oformat excel

Input file format

   The input is a standard EMBOSS taxonomy query.

   The expected source of taxonomy information is the NCBI Taxonomy
   database "taxon" which is available as a standard database in all
   EMBOSS installations.

   Data can also be read from taxonomy output in "ncbi" format written by
   an EMBOSS application.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/TaxonFormats.html for further
   information on taxon formats.

  Input files for usage example

   'ttax:9605' is a sequence entry in the example taxonomy database 'ttax'

  Database entry: ttax:9605

id: 9605
parent: 207598
rank: genus
emblprefix:
division: 5
divflag: 1
gencode: 1
gcflag: 1
mitocode: 2
mgcflag 1
hidden: 1
nosequence: 1
scientific name: Homo
authority: Homo Linnaeus, 1758


Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS taxon file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -oformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: ncbi, ebi,
   tax, excel.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/TaxonFormats.html for further
   information on taxon formats.
