                               Program restrict
                                       
Function

   Finds restriction enzyme cleavage sites
   
Description

   Restrict uses the REBASE database of restriction enzymes to predict
   cut sites in a DNA sequence. The program allows you to select a range
   of cuts, whether the DNA is circular, whether IUB ambiguity codes are
   used, whether blunt or sticky ends or both are reported. You may also
   force the reporting of single cleavage sites.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with restrict.

% restrict
Finds restriction enzyme cleavage sites
Input sequence(s): embl:hsfau
Minimum recognition site length [4]:
Comma separated enzyme list [all]:
Output file [hsfau.restrict]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
   -sitelen            integer    Minimum recognition site length
   -enzymes            string     The name 'all' reads in all enzyme names
                                  from the REBASE database. You can specify
                                  enzymes by giving their names with commas
                                  between then, such as:
                                  'HincII,hinfI,ppiI,hindiii'.
                                  The case of the names is not important. You
                                  can specify a file of enzyme names to read
                                  in by giving the name of the file holding
                                  the enzyme names with a '@' character in
                                  front of it, for example, '@enz.list'.
                                  Blank lines and lines starting with a hash
                                  character or '!' are ignored and all other
                                  lines are concatenated together with a comma
                                  character ',' and then treated as the list
                                  of enzymes to search for.
                                  An example of a file of enzyme names is:
                                  ! my enzymes
                                  HincII, ppiII
                                  ! other enzymes
                                  hindiii
                                  HinfI
                                  PpiI
  [-outfile]           outfile    Output file name

Input file format

   The input sequence can be one or more DNA sequences.
   
Output file format

   The output from restrict is a simple text one. The base number,
   restriction enzyme name, recognition site and cut positions are shown.
   Note that cuts are always to the right of the residue shown and that
   5' cuts are referred to by their associated 3' number sequence. The
   program reports enzymes that cut at two or four sites. The program
   also reports isoschizomers and enzymes having the same recognition
   sequence but different cut sites. Here is part of a sample output:

Data files

   The data files are stored in the REBASE directory of the standard
   EMBOSS data directory. The names are:
     * embossre.enz Cleavage information
     * embossre.ref Reference/methylation information
     * embossre.sup Supplier information
       
   The column information is described at the top of the data files
   
Notes

   Output file size is related to the size of the recognition site and
   the maximum number of allowed cutting positions. Setting the site
   length to six and restricting the cuts to two is a common choice of
   parameters. The size of the output can sometimes be reduced by
   specifying the -noambiguity switch.
   
   The data files must have been created before running this program.
   This is done by running the rebaseextract program with the "withrefm"
   file from an REBASE release. You may have to ask your system manager
   to do this.
