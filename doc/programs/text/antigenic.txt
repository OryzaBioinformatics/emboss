Function

   Finds antigenic sites in proteins
   
Description

   Antigenic predicts potentially antigenic regions of a protein
   sequence, using the method of Kolaskar and Tongaonkar.
   
   Analysis of data from experimentally determined antigenic sites on
   proteins has revealed that the hydrophobic residues Cys, Leu and Val,
   if they occur on the surface of a protein, are more likely to be a
   part of antigenic sites. A semi-empirical method which makes use of
   physicochemical properties of amino acid residues and their
   frequencies of occurrence in experimentally known segmental epitopes
   was developed by Kolaskar and Tongaonkar to predict antigenic
   determinants on proteins. Application of this method to a large number
   of proteins has shown that their method can predict antigenic
   determinants with about 75% accuracy which is better than most of the
   known methods. This method is based on a single parameter and thus
   very simple to use.

Data files

   Antigenic uses a data file called Eantigenic.dat.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
       
   Here is the default Eantigenic.dat file:
