                                 Program remap
                                       
Function

   Display a sequence with restriction cut sites, translation etc
   
Description

   The Restriction Enzyme database (REBASE) is a collection of
   information about restriction enzymes and related proteins. It
   contains published and unpublished references, recognition and
   cleavage sites, isoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation
   sensitivity, crystal and sequence data. DNA methyltransferases, homing
   endonucleases, nicking enzymes, specificity subunits and control
   proteins are also included. Most recently, putative DNA
   methyltransferases and restriction enzymes, as predicted from analysis
   of genomic sequences, are also listed.
   
   The home page of REBASE is: http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html
   
   This program uses REBASE data to find the recognition sites and/or cut
   sites of restriction enzymes in a nucleic acid sequence.
   
   This program displays the cut sites on both strands by default. It
   will optionally also display the translation of the sequence.
   
   There are many options to change the style of display to aid in making
   clear presentations.
   
   One potentially very useful option is '-flatreformat' that displays
   not only the cut sites which many other restriction cut-site programs
   will show, but also shows the recognition site.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with remap. We only look at a small section
   of the sequence to save space.

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
  [-outfile]           outfile    If you enter the name of a file here then
                                  this program will write the sequence details
                                  into that file.
   -enzymes            string     The name 'all' reads in all enzyme names
                                  from the REBASE database. You can specify
                                  enzymes by giving their names with commas
                                  between then, such as:
                                  'HincII,hinfI,ppiI,hindiii'.
                                  The case of the names is not important. You
                                  can specify a file of enzyme names to read
                                  in by giving the name of the file holding
                                  the enzyme names with a '@' character in
                                  front of it, for example, '@enz.list'.
                                  Blank lines and lines starting with a hash
                                  character or '!' are ignored and all other
                                  lines are concatenated together with a comma
                                  character ',' and then treated as the list
                                  of enzymes to search for.
                                  An example of a file of enzyme names is:
                                  ! my enzymes
                                  HincII, ppiII

                                  pairs of positions.
                                  The positions are integers.
                                  They are separated by any non-digit,
                                  non-alpha character.

                                  If this is left blank, then the sequence is
                                  left alone.
                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of

                                  The positions are integers.
                                  They are followed by any valid HTML font
                                  colour.

Input file format

   You can specifiy a file of ranges to display in uppercase by giving
   the '-uppercase' qualifier the value '@' followed by the name of the
   file containing the ranges. (eg: '-upper @myfile').
   
   The format of the range file is:
     * Comment lines start with '#' in the first column.
     * Comment lines and blank lines are ignored.
     * The line may start with white-space.
     * There are two positive (integer) numbers per line separated by one
       or more space or TAB characters.
     * The second number must be greater or equal to the first number.
     * There can be optional text after the two numbers to annotate the
       line.
     * White-space before or after the text is removed.
       
   An example range file is:

# this is my set of ranges
12   23
 4   5       this is like 12-23, but smaller
67   10348   interesting region

   You can specifiy a file of ranges to highlight in a different colour
   when outputting in HTML format (using the '-html' qualifier) by giving
   the '-highlight' qualifier the value '@' followed by the name of the
   file containing the ranges. (eg: '-highlight @myfile').
   
   The format of this file is very similar to the format of the above
   uppercase range file, except that the text after the start and end
   positions is used as the HTML colour name. This colour name is used
   'as is' when specifying the colour in HTML in a '<FONT COLOR=xxx>'
   construct, (where 'xxx' is the name of the colour).
   
   The standard names of HTML font colours are given in:
   http://www.iconbazaar.com/color_tables/named_colors.html
   
   An example highlight range file is:

# this is my set of ranges
12   23         red
 4   5          darkturquoise
67   10348      #FFE4E1

Output file format

   The output file from the example above follows:

     Bsu6I  1
     Hin6I  2
      TaqI  1

   The name of the sequence is displayed, followed by the description of
   the sequence.
   
   The formatted display of cut sites on the sequence follows, with the
   six-frame translation below it. The cut sites are indicated by a slash
   character '\' that points to the poition between the nucleotides where
   the cuts occur. Cuts by many enzymes at the same position are
   indicated by stacking the enzyme names on top of each other.
   
   At the end the section header 'Enzymes that cut' is displayed followed
   by a list of the enzymes that cut the specified sequence and the
   number of times that they cut.
   
   The '-flatreformat' qualifier changes the display to emphasise the
   recognition site of the restriction enzyme, which is indicated by a
   row of '=' characters. The cut site if pointed to by a '>' or '<'
   character and if the cut site is not within or imemdiately adjacent to
   the recognition site, they are linked by a row or '.' characters.
   
   The name of the enzyme is displayed above (or below when the reverse
   sense site if displayed) the recognition site. The name of the enzyme
   is also displayed above the cut site if this occurs on a different
   display line to the recognition site (i.e. if it wraps onto the next
   line of sequence).
   
   An example of this display follows with the translation turned off to
   save space:

   This uses the EMBOSS REBASE data files in 'data/REBASE/*' under the
   EMBOSS installation directory.
   
   These files must first be set up using the program 'rebaseextract'.
   Running 'rebaseextract' may be the job of your system manager.
