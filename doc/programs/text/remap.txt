Function

   Display restriction enzyme binding sites in a nucleotide sequence

Description

   remap scans one or more nucleotide sequences for recognition sites
   and/or cut sites for a supplied set of restriction enzymes. One or more
   restriction enzymes can be specified or alternatively all the enzymes
   in the REBASE database can be investigated. The minimum length of a
   recognition site to be reported must be specified. It writes an output
   file showing the location of the cut sites and (optionally) the
   recognition sites. Sites on both strands are shown by default but there
   are many options to control exactly what sites are reported and the
   format of the output file. Optionally, the translated sequence is
   reported. Additionally, the output file lists enzymess that cut / do
   not cut the sequence and which match / do not matching certain
   specified criteria.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with remap

   This example uses only a small region of the input sequence to save
   space. This is run with a small test version of the restriction enzyme
   database and so you will probably see more enzymes when you run this.


% remap -notran -sbeg 1 -send 60
Display restriction enzyme binding sites in a nucleotide sequence
Input nucleotide sequence(s): tembl:j01636
Comma separated enzyme list [all]: taqi,bsu6i,acii,bsski
Minimum recognition site length [4]:
Output file [j01636.remap]:

   Example 2

   This is an example where all enzymes in the REBASE database are used,
   (but only the prototypes of the isoschizomers are reported by default).
   This is run with a small test version of the restriction enzyme
   database and so you will probably see more enzymes when you run this.


% remap -notran -sbeg 1 -send 60
Display restriction enzyme binding sites in a nucleotide sequence
Input nucleotide sequence(s): tembl:j01636
Comma separated enzyme list [all]:
Minimum recognition site length [4]:
Output file [j01636.remap]:

   Example 3

   This is an example where all enzymes in the REBASE database are used
   but the -limit qualifier is not set so that all of the enzymes are
   displayed and not just only the prototypes of the isoschizomers. This
   is run with a small test version of the restriction enzyme database and
   so you will probably see more enzymes when you run this.


% remap -notran -sbeg 1 -send 60 -nolimit
Display restriction enzyme binding sites in a nucleotide sequence
Input nucleotide sequence(s): tembl:j01636
Comma separated enzyme list [all]:

   Example 4

   This shows the 'flat' format: This is run with a small test version of
   the restriction enzyme database and so you will probably see more
   enzymes when you run this.

Version: EMBOSS:6.2.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Nucleotide sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
   -enzymes            string     [all] The name 'all' reads in all enzyme
                                  names from the REBASE database. You can
                                  specify enzymes by giving their names with
                                  commas between then, such as:
                                  'HincII,hinfI,ppiI,hindiii'.
                                  The case of the names is not important. You
                                  can specify a file of enzyme names to read
                                  in by giving the name of the file holding
                                  the enzyme names with a '@' character in
                                  front of it, for example, '@enz.list'.
                                  Blank lines and lines starting with a hash
                                  character or '!' are ignored and all other
                                  lines are concatenated together with a comma
                                  character ',' and then treated as the list
                                  of enzymes to search for.
                                  An example of a file of enzyme names is:
                                  ! my enzymes
                                  HincII, ppiII
                                  ! other enzymes
                                  hindiii
                                  HinfI
                                  PpiI (Any string)
   -sitelen            integer    [4] This sets the minimum length of the
                                  restriction enzyme recognition site. Any
                                  enzymes with sites shorter than this will be
                                  ignored. (Integer from 2 to 20)
  [-outfile]           outfile    [*.remap] Output file name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -mincuts            integer    [1] This sets the minimum number of cuts for
                                  any restriction enzyme that will be
                                  considered. Any enzymes that cut fewer times
                                  than this will be ignored. (Integer from 1
                                  to 1000)
   -maxcuts            integer    [2000000000] This sets the maximum number of
                                  cuts for any restriction enzyme that will
                                  be considered. Any enzymes that cut more
                                  times than this will be ignored. (Integer up
                                  to 2000000000)
   -single             boolean    [N] If this is set then this forces the
                                  values of the mincuts and maxcuts qualifiers
                                  to both be 1. Any other value you may have
                                  set them to will be ignored.
   -[no]blunt          boolean    [Y] This allows those enzymes which cut at
                                  the same position on the forward and reverse
                                  strands to be considered.
   -[no]sticky         boolean    [Y] This allows those enzymes which cut at
                                  different positions on the forward and
                                  reverse strands, leaving an overhang, to be
                                  considered.
   -[no]ambiguity      boolean    [Y] This allows those enzymes which have one
                                  or more 'N' ambiguity codes in their
                                  pattern to be considered
   -plasmid            boolean    [N] If this is set then this allows searches
                                  for restriction enzyme recognition site and
                                  cut postions that span the end of the
                                  sequence to be considered.
   -methylation        boolean    [N] If this is set then RE recognition sites
                                  will not match methylated bases.
   -[no]commercial     boolean    [Y] If this is set, then only those enzymes
                                  with a commercial supplier will be searched
                                  for. This qualifier is ignored if you have
                                  specified an explicit list of enzymes to
                                  search for, rather than searching through
                                  'all' the enzymes in the REBASE database. It
                                  is assumed that, if you are asking for an
                                  explicit enzyme, then you probably know
                                  where to get it from and so all enzymes
                                  names that you have asked to be searched
                                  for, and which cut, will be reported whether
                                  or not they have a commercial supplier.

   -frame              menu       [6] This allows you to specify the frames
                                  that are translated. If you are not
                                  displaying cut sites on the reverse sense,
                                  then the reverse sense translations will not
                                  be displayed even if you have requested
                                  frames 4, 5 or 6. By default, all six frames
                                  will be displayed. (Values: 1 (1); 2 (2); 3

                                  (All six frames))
   -[no]cutlist        boolean    [Y] This produces lists in the output of the
                                  enzymes that cut, those that cut but are
                                  excluded because that cut fewer times than
                                  mincut or more times than maxcut and those
                                  enzymes that do not cut.
   -flatreformat       boolean    [N] This changes the output format to one
                                  where the recognition site is indicated by a
                                  row of '===' characters and the cut site is
                                  pointed to by a '>' character in the
                                  forward sense, or a '<' in the reverse sense
                                  strand.
   -[no]limit          boolean    [Y] This limits the reporting of enzymes to
                                  just one enzyme from each group of
                                  isoschizomers. The enzyme chosen to
                                  represent an isoschizomer group is the
                                  prototype indicated in the data file
                                  'embossre.equ', which is created by the
                                  program 'rebaseextract'. If you prefer
                                  different prototypes to be used, make a copy
                                  of embossre.equ in your home directory and
                                  edit it. If this value is set to be false
                                  then all of the input enzymes will be
                                  reported. You might like to set this to
                                  false if you are supplying an explicit set
                                  of enzymes rather than searching 'all' of
                                  them.

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:

   -[no]translation    boolean    [Y] This displays the 6-frame translations
                                  of the sequence in the output.
   -[no]reverse        boolean    [Y] This displays the cut sites and
                                  translation of the reverse sense.
   -orfminsize         integer    [If this value is left as 0 then all of the

                                  size of Open Reading Frames (ORFs) to
                                  display in the translations. All other
                                  translation regions are masked by changing
                                  the amino acids to '-' characters. (Integer
                                  0 or more)
   -uppercase          range      [If this is left blank, then the sequence

                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of
                                  pairs of positions.
                                  The positions are integers.

                                  If this is left blank, then the sequence is
                                  left alone.
                                  A set of regions is specified by a set of
                                  pairs of positions.
                                  The positions are integers.
                                  They are followed by any valid HTML font
                                  colour.

   You can specifiy a file of ranges to display in uppercase by giving the
   '-uppercase' qualifier the value '@' followed by the name of the file
   containing the ranges. (eg: '-upper @myfile').

   The format of the range file is:

     * Comment lines start with '#' in the first column.
     * Comment lines and blank lines are ignored.
     * The line may start with white-space.
     * There are two positive (integer) numbers per line separated by one
       or more space or TAB characters.
     * The second number must be greater or equal to the first number.
     * There can be optional text after the two numbers to annotate the
       line.
     * White-space before or after the text is removed.

   An example range file is:

# this is my set of ranges
12   23
 4   5       this is like 12-23, but smaller
67   10348   interesting region


   You can specifiy a file of ranges to highlight in a different colour
   when outputting in HTML format (using the '-html' qualifier) by giving
   the '-highlight' qualifier the value '@' followed by the name of the
   file containing the ranges. (eg: '-highlight @myfile').

   The format of this file is very similar to the format of the above
   uppercase range file, except that the text after the start and end
   positions is used as the HTML colour name. This colour name is used 'as
   is' when specifying the colour in HTML in a '<FONT COLOR=xxx>'
   construct, (where 'xxx' is the name of the colour).

   The standard names of HTML font colours are given in:
   http://http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html and
   http://www.ausmall.com.au/freegraf/ncolour2.htm and
   http://mindprod.com/htmlcolours.html (amongst other places).

   An example highlight range file is:
     __________________________________________________________________

# this is my set of ranges
12   23         red
 4   5          darkturquoise
67   10348      #FFE4E1

   The name of the sequence is displayed, followed by the description of
   the sequence.

   The formatted display of cut sites on the sequence follows, with the
   six-frame translation below it. The cut sites are indicated by a slash
   character '\' that points to the poition between the nucleotides where
   the cuts occur. Cuts by many enzymes at the same position are indicated
   by stacking the enzyme names on top of each other.

   At the end the section header 'Enzymes that cut' is displayed followed
   by a list of the enzymes that cut the specified sequence and the number
   of times that they cut. For each enzyme that cuts, a list of
   isoschizomers of that enzyme (sharing the same recognition site pattern
   and cut sites) is given.

   This is followed by lists of the enzymes that do cut, but which cut
   less often than the '-mincut' qualifier or more often than the
   '-maxcut' qualifier.

   Any of the isoschizomers that are excluded from cutting, (either
   through restrictions such as the permitted number of cuts, blunt
   cutters only, single cutters only etc. or because their name has not
   been given in the input list of enzymes), will not be listed.

   Then a list is displayed of the enzymes whose names were input and
   which match the other criteria ('-sitelen', '-blunt', '-sticky',
   '-ambiguity' or '-commercial') but which do not cut.

   Finally the number of enzymes that were rejected from consideration
   because they do not match the '-sitelen', '-blunt', '-sticky',
   '-ambiguity' or '-commercial' criteria is displayed.

   The '-flatreformat' qualifier changes the display to emphasise the
   recognition site of the restriction enzyme, which is indicated by a row
   of '=' characters. The cut site if pointed to by a '>' or '<' character
   and if the cut site is not within or imemdiately adjacent to the
   recognition site, they are linked by a row of '.' characters.

   The name of the enzyme is displayed above (or below when the reverse
   sense site if displayed) the recognition site. The name of the enzyme
   is also displayed above the cut site if this occurs on a different
   display line to the recognition site (i.e. if it wraps onto the next
   line of sequence).

Data files

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat


   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata". Files
   for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or again
   in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

   The EMBOSS REBASE restriction enzyme data files are stored in directory
   'data/REBASE/*' under the EMBOSS installation directory.

   These files must first be set up using the program 'rebaseextract'.
   Running 'rebaseextract' may be the job of your system manager.

   The data files are stored in the REBASE directory of the standard
   EMBOSS data directory. The names are:
     * embossre.enz Cleavage information
     * embossre.ref Reference/methylation information
     * embossre.sup Supplier information

   The column information is described at the top of the data files

   The reported enzyme from any one group of isoschizomers (the prototype)
   is specified in the REBASE database and the information is held in the
   data file 'embossre.equ'. You may edit this file to set your own
   preferred prototype, if you wish.

   The format of the file "embossre.equ" is
   Enzyme-name Prototype-name

   i.e. two columns of enzyme names separated by a space. The first name
   of the pair of enzymes is the name that is not preferred and the second
   is the preferred (prototype) name.

Notes

   The Restriction Enzyme database (REBASE) is a collection of information
   about restriction enzymes and related proteins. It contains published
   and unpublished references, recognition and cleavage sites,
   isoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation sensitivity,
   crystal and sequence data. DNA methyltransferases, homing
   endonucleases, nicking enzymes, specificity subunits and control
   proteins are also included. Most recently, putative DNA
   methyltransferases and restriction enzymes, as predicted from analysis
   of genomic sequences, are also listed.

   The home page of REBASE is: http://rebase.neb.com/

   Where the translation is given in the output file, the genetic code and
   one or more frames for translation may be specified. The -no[reverse]
   option specifies whether the translation (and cut and recognition
   sites) are shown for the reverse sense strand.

   By default, only one enzyme of any group of isoschizomers (enzymes that
   have the same recognition site and cut positions) is reported. This
   behaviour can be changed by specifying -nolimit, in which case all
   isoschizomers are reported. The default behaviour uses the
   representative enzyme of an isoschizomer group (the prototype) which is
   specified in the EMBOSS data file embossre.equ. This file is generated
   from the REBASE database by running rebaseextract. You may edit this
   file to set your own preferred prototype, if you wish.

   As well as the display of where enzymes cut in the sequence, remap
   displays:
     * The list of enzymes that cut the sequence and match the required
       criteria.
     * The list of enzymes that cut the sequence and fail the MINCUTS
       criteria.
     * The list of enzymes that cut the sequence and fail the MAXCUTS
       criteria.
     * The list of enzymes that do not cut the sequence but which match
       all the required criteria.
     * The number of enzymes that cut the sequence and fail the SITELEN,
       BLUNT, STICKY, COMMERCIAL, AMBIGUOUS criteria.

Warnings

   remap uses the EMBOSS REBASE restriction enzyme data files stored in
   directory data/REBASE/* under the EMBOSS installation directory. These
   files must first be set up using the program rebaseextract. Running
   rebaseextract may be the job of your system manager.
