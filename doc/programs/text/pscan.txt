Function

   Scans proteins using PRINTS
   
Description

   PRINTS is a database of diagnostic protein signatures, or
   fingerprints.
   
   Fingerprints are groups of conserved motifs or elements that together
   form a diagnostic signature for particular protein families.
   
   An uncharacterised sequence matching all motifs or elements can then
   be readily diagnosed as a true match to a particular family
   fingerprint.
   
   They can be used to diagnose family relationships in newly-determined
   sequences (especially from genome projects).
   
   Usually the motifs or elements do not overlap, but are separated along
   a sequence, though they may be contiguous in 3D-space. Fingerprints
   can encode protein folds and functionalities more flexibly and
   powerfully than can single motifs, full diagnostic potency deriving
   from the mutual context provided by motif neighbours.
   
   Diagnostically, this is more powerful than using single motifs by
   virtue of the biological context afforded by matching motif
   neighbours.
   
   pscan finds matches between a query protein sequence and the motifs or
   elements in the PRINTS database. It reports various classes of
   matches:
   
     * Matches where all elements of a motif exist in the correct order
     * Matches where all elements exist but some are in the incorrect
       order
     * Matches where some elements match and are in the correct order
     * Miscellaneous matches.

          order

Data files

   The data file is stored in the PRINTS directory of the standard EMBOSS
   data directory.
     * prints.mat Matrices derived from PRINTS
     * Pxxxxx Information for each fingerprint
       
   The column information is described at the top of the matrix data file
   
Notes

   The matrix information used to scan a sequence is derived from the
   final motif sets in the PRINTS database. The matrices are of the
   simple frequency type and contain the number of times a residue occurs
   in each position of the alignment. Each matrix therefore has a highest
   possible score, being the sum of the maximum score of each column. A
   match to the sequence window is obtained if it has a score equal to or
   greater than the percentage of the maximum score of the lowest scoring
   sequence in the final motif set.
   
   The data files must have been created before running this program.
   This is done by running the printsextract program with the
   "prints.dat" file from a PRINTS release. You may have to ask your
   system manager to do this.

Warnings

   The program will warn you if a DNA sequence is given.
   
Diagnostic Error Messages

   If you get the following EMBOSS FATAL ERROR message:

"prints.mat file not found. Create it with printsextract."

   then your local PRINTS data has not been set up correctly in your
   EMBOSS DATA directory. Use 'printsextract' to do this.
   
Exit status

   It exits with status 0 unless an error is reported.
