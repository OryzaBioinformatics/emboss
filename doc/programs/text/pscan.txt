Function

   Scans protein sequence(s) with fingerprints from the PRINTS database

Description

   pscan reads one or more protein sequences and searches them against the
   PRINTS database of diagnostic protein signatures (fingerprints). A
   fingerprint is a group of conserved motifs or elements that together
   form a diagnostic signature for a particular protein family. The
   minimum and maximum number of elements per fingerprint may be
   specified. pscan writes an output file with details of any matches
   between each input sequence and the fingerprints. It reports various
   classes of matches:
     * Matches where all elements of a motif exist in the correct order
     * Matches where all elements exist but some are in the incorrect
       order
     * Matches where some elements match and are in the correct order
     * Miscellaneous matches.

Algorithm

   The matrix information used to scan a sequence is derived from the
   final motif sets in the PRINTS database. The matrices are of the simple
   frequency type and contain the number of times a residue occurs in each
   position of a PRINTS alignment. Each matrix therefore has a highest
   possible score, being the sum of the maximum score of each column. A
   match to a window over the input sequence is obtained if it has a score
   equal to or greater than the percentage of the maximum score of the
   lowest scoring sequence in the final motif set.

   The program reports hits in four classes.

   Class1:
          Matches where all elements of a motif exist in the correct order

   Class2:
          Matches where all elements exist but some are in the incorrect
          order

   Class3:
          Matches where some elements match and are in the correct order

   Class4:
          Miscellaneous matches

Data files

   The data file is stored in the PRINTS directory of the standard EMBOSS
   data directory.
     * prints.mat Matrices derived from PRINTS
     * Pxxxxx Information for each fingerprint

   The column information is described at the top of the matrix data file

Notes

   Fingerprints are groups of conserved motifs or elements that together
   form a diagnostic signature for particular protein families. An
   uncharacterised sequence matching all motifs or elements can then be
   readily diagnosed as a true match to a particular family fingerprint.
   They can be used to diagnose family relationships in newly-determined
   sequences (especially from genome projects).

   Usually the motifs or elements do not overlap, but are separated along
   a sequence, though they may be contiguous in 3D-space. Fingerprints can
   encode protein folds and functionalities more flexibly and powerfully
   than can single motifs, full diagnostic potency deriving from the
   mutual context provided by motif neighbours. Diagnostically, this is
   more powerful than using single motifs by virtue of the biological
   context afforded by matching motif neighbours.

Warnings

   The data files must have been created before running this program. This
   is done by running the printsextract program with the prints.dat file
   from a PRINTS release. You may have to ask your system manager to do
   this.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   If you get the following EMBOSS FATAL ERROR message:

"prints.mat file not found. Create it with printsextract."


   then your local PRINTS data has not been set up correctly in your
   EMBOSS DATA directory. Use 'printsextract' to do this.

Exit status

   It exits with status 0 unless an error is reported.
