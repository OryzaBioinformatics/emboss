                              Program megamerger
                                       
Function

   Merge two large overlapping nucleic acid sequences
   
Description

   megamerger takes two overlapping sequences and merges them into one
   sequence. It could thus be regarded as the opposite of what splitter
   does.
   
   The sequences can be very long. The program does a match of all
   sequence words of size 20 (by default). It then reduces this to the
   minimum set of overlapping matches by sorting the matches in order of
   size (largest size first) and then for each such match it removes any
   smaller matches that overlap. The result is a set of the longest
   ungapped alignments between the two sequences that do not overlap with
   each other. If the two sequences are identical in their region of
   overlap then there will be one region of match and no mismatches.
   
   It should be possible to merge sequences that are Mega bytes long.
   Compare this with the program merger which does a more accurate
   alignment of more divergent sequences using the Needle and Wunsch
   algorithm but which uses much more memory.
   
   The sequences should ideally be identical in their region of overlap.
   If there are any mismatches between the two sequences then megamerger
   will still attempt to create a merged sequence, but you should check
   that this is what you required.
   
   A report of the actions of megamerger is written out. Any actions that
   require a choice between using regions of the two sequences where they
   have a mismatch is marked with the word WARNING!. The sequence in
   these regions is written out in uppercase. All other regions of the
   output sequence are written in lowercase.
   
   Where there is a mismatch then the sequence that is chosen to supply
   the region of the mismatch in the final merged sequence is that
   sequence whose mismatch region is furthest from the start of end of
   the sequence.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with megamerger, there are many mismatches
   between these two sequences and the merged sequence should therefore
   be treated with great caution:

% megamerger embl:ap000504 embl:af129756
Merge two large overlapping nucleic acid sequences
Output sequence [ap000504.merged]:
Output file [stdout]: report
Word size [20]:

   [-seqb]
   (Parameter 2) Sequence USA Readable sequence Required
   [-outseq]

Input file format

   Sequence USAs.
   
Output file format

   A merged sequence is written out.
   
   Where there has been a mismatch between the two sequences, the merged
   sequence is written out in uppercase and the sequence whose mismatch
   region is furthest from the edges of the sequence is used in the
   merged sequence.
   
   The name and description of the first input sequence is used for the
   name and description of the output sequence. A report of the merger is
   written out.
   
   A typical report where there are many mismatches, taken from the
   example above follows:
   
# Report of megamerger of: AP000504 and AF129756

AP000504 overlap starts at 1
AF129756 overlap starts at 6036

Using AF129756 1-6035 as the initial sequence
