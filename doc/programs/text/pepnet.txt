                                Program pepnet
                                       
Function

   Displays proteins as a helical net
   
Description

   This is a method of displaying the residues of a protein in a simple
   3,4,3,4 repeating pattern that emulates at a simple level the
   arrangement of residues around an alpha helix.
   
   It is therefore easy to see patterns of amphipathicity that you may
   wish to investigate in more detail by using displays such as pepwheel.
   
   You can specify which residues to mark up in squares, diamonds and
   octagons.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with pepnet.

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-sequence]          sequence   Sequence USA
*  -graph              graph      Graph type

   Optional qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
*  -squares            string     By default the aliphatic residues ILVM are
                                  marked with squares.
*  -diamonds           string     By default the residues DENQST are marked
                                  with diamonds.
*  -octags             string     By default the positively charged residues
                                  HKR are marked with octagons.

   Advanced qualifiers:
   -amphipathic        bool       If this is true then the residues ACFGILMVWY
                                  are marked as squares and all other
                                  residues are unmarked. This overrides any
                                  other markup that you may have specified
                                  using the qualifiers '-squares', '-diamonds'
                                  and '-octags'.
   -data               bool       Output the data to a file instead of
                                  plotting it

   EMBOSS_GRAPHICS value, or x11
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -squares By default the aliphatic residues ILVM are marked with
   squares. Any string is accepted ILVM
   -diamonds By default the residues DENQST are marked with diamonds. Any
   string is accepted DENQST
   -octags By default the positively charged residues HKR are marked with
   octagons. Any string is accepted HKR
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -amphipathic If this is true then the residues ACFGILMVWY are marked
   as squares and all other residues are unmarked. This overrides any
   other markup that you may have specified using the qualifiers
   '-squares', '-diamonds' and '-octags'. Yes/No No
   -data Output the data to a file instead of plotting it Yes/No No
