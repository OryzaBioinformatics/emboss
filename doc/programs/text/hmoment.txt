Function

   Hydrophobic moment calculation
   
Description

   hmoment plots or writes out the hydrophobic moment. Hydrophic moment
   is the hydrophobicity of a peptide measured for a specified angle of
   rotation per residue.
   
   Periodicities in the polar/apolar character of the amino acid sequence
   of a protein can be examined by assigning to each residue a numerical
   hydrophobicity and searching for periodicity in the resulting
   one-dimensional function. The strength of each periodic component is
   the quantity that has been termed the hydrophobic moment.
   
   When proteins of known three-dimensional structure are examined, it is
   found that sequences that form alpha helices tend to have, on average,
   a strong periodicity in the hydrophobicity of af 3.6 residues, the
   period of the alpha helix. The angle of rotation per residue in alpha
   helices is 100 degrees. Similarly, many sequences that form strands of
   beta sheets tend to have a periodicity in their hydrophobicity of
   about 2.3 residues, the period typical of beta structure. The angle of
   rotation per residue in beta sheets is 160 degrees. This means that
   many protein sequences tend to form the periodic structure that
   maximizes their amphiphilicity.
   
   The hydrophobic moment is measured within a moving window using the
   method of Eisenberg et al. The default angle of 100 degrees is used
   for the alpha-helix results and the default of 160 degrees is used for
   the beta-sheet results. These angles can be changed if required using
   the appropriate options.
   
   hmoment can plot two graphs when the option '-double' is given, one
   for the alpha helix moment and one for the beta sheet moment.
   Otherwise it just plots the alpha helix moment.

Input file format

   hmoment reads in a protein sequence.
   
Output file format

   With the '-plot' option hmoment displays a graphical plot of the
   hydrophobic moment of the specified alpha helix angle. With the '-plot
   -double' options it also displays the beta-sheet hydrophobic moment.
   
   Otherwise it writes out a files containing the two columns separated
   by space or TAB characters. The first column is the position of the
   start of the window that the hydrophobic moment was calculated in. The
   second is the hydrophobic moment ('uH'). (If the option '-double' is
   given then the beta-sheet angle hydrophobicity is given as a third
   column.)
   
   The ouput of the above is example follows:
