                                Program pepinfo
                                       
Function

   Plots simple amino acid properties in parallel
   
Description

   pepinfo detects and displays various useful metrics about a protein
   sequence.
   
   It can plot and display the following properties:
     * plots of hydrophobicity (using the method of Kyte & Doolittle), of
       OHM (Sweet & Eisenberg), or of consensus parameters (Eisenberg et
       al))
     * a histogram of the presence of residues with the physico-chemical
       properties: Tiny, Small, Aliphatic, Aromatic, Non-polar, Polar,
       Charged, Positive, Negative.
       
   The data are also written out to a data file.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with pepinfo.

Data files

   The physico-chemical properties of the residues are read from the
   EMBOSS data file 'Eaa_properties.dat'. This file can be copied into
   your current directory and inspected ot altered by using the
   application 'embossdata -fetch'. Another file can be specified using
   the qualifier '-aaproperties'.
   
   The hydropathy data of the residues are read from the EMBOSS data file
   'Eaa_hydropathy.dat'. This file can be copied into your current
   directory and inspected ot altered by using the application
   'embossdata -fetch'. Another file can be specified using the qualifier
   '-aahydropathy'.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
