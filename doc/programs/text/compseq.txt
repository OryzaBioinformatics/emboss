                                Program compseq
                                       
Function

   Counts the composition of dimer/trimer/etc words in a sequence
   
Description

   This takes a specified length of sequence and counts the number of
   distinct subsequences of that length that there are in the input
   sequence(s). It can read in the result of a previous compseq analysis
   and use this to set the expected frequencies of the subsequences.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with compseq.

To count the frequencies of dinucleotides in a file:

% compseq  embl:hsfau  2  result3.comp

To count the frequencies of hexanucleotides, without outputting
the results of hexanucleotides that do not occur in the sequence:

% compseq  embl:hsfau  6  result6.comp  -nozero

To count the frequencies of trinucleotides in frame 2 of a sequence
and use a previously prepared compseq output to show the expected
frequencies:

% compseq  embl:hsfau  3  result3.comp  -frame 2  -in prev.comp

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
  [-word]              integer    This is the size of word (n-mer) to count.
                                  Thus if you want to count codon frequencies,
                                  you should enter 3 here.
  [-outfile]           outfile    This is the results file.

   Optional qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -infile             infile     This is a file previously produced by
                                  'compseq' that can be used to set the
                                  expected frequencies of words in this
                                  analysis.
                                  The word size in the current run must be the
                                  same as the one in this results file.
                                  Obviously, you should use a file produced
                                  from protein sequences if you are counting
                                  protein sequence word frequencies, and you
                                  must use one made from nucleotide
                                  frequencies if you and analysing a
                                  nucleotide sequence.
   -[no]zerocount      bool       You can make the output results file much
                                  smaller if you do not display the words with
                                  a zero count.
   -frame              integer    The normal behaviour of 'compseq' is to
                                  count the frequencies of all words that
                                  occur by moving a window of length 'word' up
                                  by one each time.
                                  This option allows you to move the window up
                                  by the length of the word each time,
                                  skipping over the intervening words.
                                  You can count only those words that occur in
                                  a single frame of the word by setting this
                                  value to a number other than zero.
                                  If you set it to 1 it will only count the
                                  words in frame 1, 2 will only count the
                                  words in frame 2 and so on.
*  -[no]ignorebz       bool       The amino acid code B represents Asparagine
                                  or Aspartic acid and the code Z represents
                                  Glutamine or Glutamic acid.
                                  These are not commonly used codes and you
                                  may wish not to count words containing them,
                                  just noting them in the count of 'Other'
                                  words.
*  -reverse            bool       Set this to be false if you do not wish to
                                  also count words in the reverse complement
                                  of the sequence.

   sequences if you are counting protein sequence word frequencies, and

   a nucleotide sequence. Input file Required

   -frame The normal behaviour of 'compseq' is to count the frequencies

Input file format

   Normal sequence(s) USA.
   
Output file format

   The output format consists of:
   
   Header information and comments are preceeded by a '#' character at
   the start of the line.
   
   The Word size and the Total count are then given on separate lines,
   
   The headers of the columns of results are preceeded by a '#'
   
   The results columns are: the sub-sequence word, the observed
   frequency, the expected frequency (which will be read from the input
   file if one is given, else it is a simple inverse of the number of
   words of the size specified that can be constructed), the ratio of the
   observed to expected frequency.
   
   After a blank line at the end, the results of 'Other' words is given -
   this is the number of words with a sequence which has IUPAC ambiguity
   codes or other unusual characters in.
   
   Example:
#
# Output from 'compseq'
#
# The Expected frequencies are taken from the file: jjj.composition
#
# The input sequences are:
#       jjj

Data files

   The input data file is not required.
   
   The input data file format is exactly the same as the output file
   format.
   
   It expects to read in a previous output file of this program. An error
   is produced if the word size of the current compseq job and that of
   the output file being read in are different.
   
Notes

   The results are held in an array in memory before being written to a
   file. For large values of wordsize, you may run out of memory.
   
   You can produce very large output files if you choose large values of
   wordsize.

Warnings

Diagnostic Error Messages

   "The word size is too large for the data structure available."
          You chose a word size that cannot be stored by the program.
          
   "Insufficient memory - aborting."
          You do not have enough memory - use a machine with more memory.
          
   "The word size you are counting (n) is different to the word size in
          the file of expected frequencies (n)."
          You chose different word sizes in the run of compseq that
          produced your results file used to display the expected word
          frequencies to the word size used in this run of compseq.
          
   "The 'Word size' line was not found, instead found:"
          You appear to be trying to read a corrupted compseq results
          file
          
Exit status

   It always exits with status 0 unless one of the above error conditions
   is found
   
Known bugs

   This program can use a large amount of memory is you specify a large
   word size (7 or above). This may impact the behaviour of other
   programs on your machine.
   
   If you run out of memory, you may see the program crash with a generic
   error message that will be specific to your machine's operating
   system, but will probably be a warning about writing to memory that
   the program does not own (eg "Segmentation fault" on a Solaris
   machine)
   
   This is not a bug, it is a feature of the way this program grabs large
   amounts of memory.
