                                Program dotpath
                                       
Function

   Displays a non-overlapping wordmatch dotplot of two sequences
   
Description

   A dotplot is a graphical representation of the regions of similarity
   between two sequences.
   
   The two sequences are placed on the axes of a rectangular image and
   wherever there is a similarity between the sequences a dot is placed
   on the image.
   
   Where the two sequences have substantial regions of similarity, many
   dots align to form diagonal lines. It is therefore possible to see at
   a glance where there are local regions of similarity.
   
   dotpath is very similar to the program dottup which looks for places
   where words (tuples) of a specified length have an exact match in both
   sequences and draws a diagonal line over the position of these words.
   
   Using a longer word size thus displays less random noise, runs
   extremely quickly, but is less sensitive.
   
   dotpath finds all matches of size -wordsize or greater between two
   sequences. It then reduces the matches found to the minimal set of
   long matches that do not overlap. This is a way of finding the
   (nearly) optimal path aligning two sequences. It is not the true
   optimal path as produced by the algorithms used in water or needle,
   but for very closely related sequences it will produce the same result
   and will work well with very long sequences.
   
   If you wish to compare the path found by dotpath to the set of all
   matches found then the qualifier -overlaps will show all matches in
   red except for the matches in the minimal path which are shown in
   black, as normal.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with dotpath:

Input file format

Output file format

   In normal operation, a dotplot image is displayed.
   
   With the -text -out qualifiers a file of the positions of the matches
   in the minimal non-overlapping set of matches is output.
   

% dotpath embl:AF129756 embl:AP000504 -word 20 -text -out af.path
Displays a non-overlapping wordmatch dotplot of two sequences
Graph type [x11]:

   Produces the output file:
   
119 matches found

Warnings

   If you give a small word size with a very large sequence you will run
   out of memory. If this happens, try again with a larger word size.
