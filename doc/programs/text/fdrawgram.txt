Function

   Plots a cladogram- or phenogram-like rooted tree diagram

Description

   Plots rooted phylogenies, cladograms, circular trees and phenograms in
   a wide variety of user-controllable formats. The program is
   interactive and allows previewing of the tree on PC, Macintosh, or X
   Windows screens, or on Tektronix or Digital graphics terminals. Final
   output can be to a file formatted for one of the drawing programs, for
   a ray-tracing or VRML browser, or one at can be sent to a laser
   printer (such as Postscript or PCL-compatible printers), on graphics
   screens or terminals, on pen plotters or on dot matrix printers
   capable of graphics.

   Similar to DRAWTREE but plots rooted phylogenies.

Algorithm

   DRAWGRAM interactively plots a cladogram- or phenogram-like rooted
   tree diagram, with many options including orientation of tree and
   branches, style of tree, label sizes and angles, tree depth, margin
   sizes, stem lengths, and placement of nodes in the tree. Particularly
   if you can use your computer to preview the plot, you can very
   effectively adjust the details of the plotting to get just the kind of
   plot you want.

   To understand the working of DRAWGRAM and DRAWTREE, you should first
   read the Tree Drawing Programs web page in this documentation.

   As with DRAWTREE, to run DRAWGRAM you need a compiled copy of the
   program, a font file, and a tree file. The tree file has a default
   name of intree. The font file has a default name of "fontfile". If
   there is no file of that name, the program will ask you for the name
   of a font file (we provide ones that have the names font1 through
   font6). Once you decide on a favorite one of these, you could make a
   copy of it and call it fontfile, and it will then be used by default.
   Note that the program will get confused if the input tree file has the
   number of trees on the first line of the file, so that numbr may have
   to be removed.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with fdrawgram


% fdrawgram -previewer n

Data files

   The font file has a default name of "fontfile". If there is no file of
   that name, the program will ask you for the name of a font file (we
   provide ones that have the names font1 through font6). Once you decide
   on a favorite one of these, you could make a copy of it and call it
   fontfile, and it will then be used by default.

Author(s)

   This program is an EMBOSS conversion of a program written by Joe
   Felsenstein as part of his PHYLIP package.

   Although we take every care to ensure that the results of the EMBOSS
   version are identical to those from the original package, we recommend
   that you check your inputs give the same results in both versions
   before publication.

   Please report all bugs in the EMBOSS version to the EMBOSS bug team,
   not to the original author.

History

   Written (2004) - Joe Felsenstein, University of Washington.

   Converted (August 2004) to an EMBASSY program by the EMBOSS team.

Target users

   This program is intended to be used by everyone and everything, from
   naive users to embedded scripts.
