Function

   Copy and reformat a codon usage table

Description

   codcopy reads and writes a codon usage table. Rather than a copy
   utility, it is intended as a format conversion utility so that codon
   usage data can be exported to other applications that support only a
   single format. This program supports all available codon usage input
   and output formats.

Algorithm

Usage

   Here is a sample session with codcopy


% codcopy 
Copy and reformat a codon usage table
Codon usage file: Eecoli.cut
Codon usage output file [eecoli.cut]: 

   Go to the output files for this example
