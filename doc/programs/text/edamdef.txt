Function

   Find EDAM ontology terms by definition

Description

   edamdef searches the definition of EDAM terms and returns matching
   terms. The input is read from the installed EDAM database. The ontology
   term output can be written to screen, to file, or passed to another
   program. A wide range of standard ontology term formats may be
   specified for input and output.

   Optionally the search can be restricted to specified EDAM namespaces.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with edamdef


% edamdef multiple

   -obsolete           boolean    [N] The default behaviour is to not use or
                                  return obsolete terms. This option if set

Input file format

   edamdef queries the EDAM ontology.

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS ontology term file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -oformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: obo,
   brief, list, html, xml, json, excel.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/OntologyFormats.html for further
   information on ontology formats.
