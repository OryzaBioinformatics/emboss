Function

   Uncompress a compressed dbx index

Description

   dbxuncompress uncompresses EMBOSS B+tree format index files. By
   default, the indexing applications in EMBOSS compress all index files.

   Indexes prior to EMBOSS 6.4.0 are uncompressed.

   Uncompressed index files are required for updating an existing index.
   Compressed index files provide more efficient storage and retrieval.

Algorithm

   The B+tree index files contain discrete pages with a known maximum
   size, filled from the first byte with a count of index terms.

   dbxcompress reads all pages, identifying the end of the used space and
   adding calculating the free space at the end of each page and
   calculating the new start position for each uncompressed page. It then
   rereads the index file, and rewrites the pages to disk expanded to the
   full page size.

   The final page is always written in full. This allows index reading to
   assume the maximum page size in all cases without reading beyond the
   end of file.

Usage
