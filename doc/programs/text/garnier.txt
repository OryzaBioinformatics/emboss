Notes

   The Garnier method is not regarded as the most accurate prediction,
   but is simple to calculate on most workstations.
   
   The Web servers for PHD, DSC, and others are generally preferred.
   
   The 3D structure for the example sequence is known, although the 2D
   structure elements were not in the SwissProt feature table for release
   38 when the test data was extracted.
   
   DSSP shows:
 From     To   Structure

   21     39   H alpha helix

   The meaning and use of the parameter 'idc' is currently being
   investigated. The original author, Bill Pearson writes:
   
   "In their paper, GOR mention that if you know something about the
   secondary structure content of the protein you are analyzing, you can
   do better in prediction. "idc" is an index into a set of arrays,
   dharr[] and dsarr[], which provide "decision constants" (dch, dcs),
   which are offsets that are applied to the weights for the helix and
   sheet (extend) terms. So, idc=0 says don't use the decision constant
   offsets, and idc=1 to 6 indicates that various combinations of dch,dcs
   offsets should be used. I don't remember what they are, but I must
   have gotten the values from their paper."

Warnings

   The accuracy of any secondary structure prediction program is not much
   better than 70% to 80% at best. This is an early algorithm and will
   probably not predict with much better than about 65% accuracy.
   
   You are advised to use several of the latest Web-based prediction
   sites and combine them to make a consensus prediction.
