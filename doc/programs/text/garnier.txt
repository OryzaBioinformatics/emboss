Function

   Predicts protein secondary structure
   
Description

   This is an implementation of the original Garnier Osguthorpe Robson
   algorithm (GOR I) for predicting protein secondary structure.
   
   Secondary structure prediction is notoriously difficult to do
   accurately. The GOR I alogorithm is one of the first semi-successful
   methods.
   
   The Garnier method is not regarded as the most accurate prediction,
   but is simple to calculate on most workstations.
   
   The accuracy of any secondary structure prediction program is not much
   better than 70% to 80% at best. This is an early algorithm and will
   probably not predict with much better than about 65% accuracy.
   
   The Web servers for PHD, DSC, and others are generally preferred.
   
   Do not rely on this (or any other) program alone to make your
   predictions with. Use several programs and take a consensus of the
   results.

   Here is a sample session with garnier.

   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -idc idc param Integer from 0 to 6 0
   
   The meaning and use of the parameter 'idc' is currently being
   investigated. The original author, Bill Pearson writes:
   
   "In their paper, GOR mention that if you know something about the
   secondary structure content of the protein you are analyzing, you can
   do better in prediction. "idc" is an index into a set of arrays,
   dharr[] and dsarr[], which provide "decision constants" (dch, dcs),
   which are offsets that are applied to the weights for the helix and
   sheet (extend) terms. So, idc=0 says don't use the decision constant
   offsets, and idc=1 to 6 indicates that various combinations of dch,dcs
   offsets should be used. I don't remember what they are, but I must
   have gotten the values from their paper."
   
Input file format

   The 3D structure for the example sequence is known, although the 2D
   structure elements were not in the SwissProt feature table for release
   38 when the test data was extracted.
