Function

   Scans a signature against swissprot and writes a signature hits files
   
Description

   sigscan scans a signature such as that generated by the EMBOSS
   application siggen against a protein sequence database and generates
   files of scored hits and corresponding alignments. An (optionally
   grouped) scop families file can be provided in which case a
   classification of hits is provided in the signature hits output file.
   See documentation for the EMBOSS application psiblasts for an
   explanation of the scop families file and groups for information on
   how to group it.
   
  Signatures
  
   Signatures extend the comcept of the motif as a tool for
   characterizing protein families. They consist of a set of N key
   residue postitions (A1, A2 ...An) preceeded by gaps (G) thus
   G1A1G2A2...GnAn. Both a residue and a gap can be variable. A signature
   is matched to a protein sequence and scored using a dynamic
   programming algorithm which permits variability in gap distance and
   residue type. Generating a signature involves identifying residues
   associated with points of contact in interactions between secondary
   structure alements. A raw signature consists of a set of positions
   with potential key structural roles sampled from a sequence alignment
   constructed with reference to this contact data. Raw signatures are
   refined by samplinfg different gap-residue pairs until the specificity
   of a signature for the family cannot be further improved.

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sigin]             infile     Name of signature file (input)
   -database           seqall     Name of swissprot sequence database to
                                  search
   -targetf            infile     Name of validation (input)
   -thresh             integer    Minimum length (residues) of overlap
                                  required for two hits with the same code to
                                  be counted as the same hit.
   -sub                matrixf    This is the scoring matrix file used when
                                  comparing sequences.
   -gapo               float      The gap insertion penalty is the score taken
                                  away when a gap is created. The best value
                                  depends on the choice of comparison matrix.
                                  The default value assumes you are using the
                                  EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein sequences, and
                                  the EDNAMAT matrix for nucleotide sequences.
   -gape               float      The gap extension, penalty is added to the
                                  standard gap penalty for each base or
                                  residue in the gap. This is how long gaps
                                  are penalized. Usually you will expect a few
                                  long gaps rather than many short gaps, so
                                  the gap extension penalty should be lower
                                  than the gap penalty. An exception is where
                                  one or both sequences are single reads with
                                  possible sequencing errors in which case you
                                  would expect many single base gaps. You can
                                  get this result by setting the gap open
                                  penalty to zero (or very low) and using the
                                  gap extension penalty to control gap
                                  scoring.

   Definition of classes of hit
   
   The primary classification is an objective definition of the hit and
   has one of the following values:
   
   TRAIN - the sequence was included in the original alignment from which
   the signature was generated.
   
   PSIBLAST - A protein which was detected by psiblast (see psiblasts.c)
   to be a homologue to at least one of the proteins in the family from
   which the signature was derived. Such proteins are identified by the
   'PSIBLAST' record in the scop families file.
   
   OTHER - A true member of the family but not a homologue as detected by
   psi-blast. Such proteins may have been found from the literature and
   manually added to the scop families file or may have been detected by
   the EMBOSS program swissparse (see swissparse.c). They are identified
   in the
   
   SCOP families file by the 'OTHER' record.
   
   CROSS - A protein which is homologous to a protein of the same fold,
   but differnt family, of the proteins from which the signature was
   derived.
   
   FALSE - A homologue to a protein with a different fold to the family
   of the signature.
   
   UNKNOWN - The protein is not known to be CROSS, FALSE or a true hit
   (TRAIN, PSIBLAST or OTHER).
   
   The secondary classification is provided for convenience and a value
   as follows:
   
   Hits of TRAIN, PSIBLAST and OTHER classification are all listed as
   TRUE.
   
   Hits of CROSS, FALSE or UNKNOWN objective classification are listed as
   CROSS, FALSE or UNKNOWN respectively.
   
   The subjective column allows for hand-annotation of the hits files so
   that proteins of UNKNOWN objective classification can re-classified by
   a human expert as TRUE, FALSE, CROSS or otherwise left as UNKNOWN for
   the purpose of generating signature performance plots with the EMBOSS
   application sigplot.
   
Data files

   None.
   
Notes

   Important - sigscan presumes that SCOP family names are unique. If
   this were not the case, changes to ajXyzClassifyHits would have to be
   made.
   
   Important - In the case where a signature file is generated by hand,
   it is essential that the gap data given is listed in order of
   increasing gap size.
