                                Program tfscan
                                       
Function

   Scans DNA sequences for transcription factors
   
Description

   The TRANSFAC Database is a database of eukaryotic cis-acting
   regulatory DNA elements and trans-acting factors. It covers the whole
   range from yeast to human.
   
   The SITE data from TRANSFAC contains information on individual
   (putatively) regulatory protein binding sites. It has been divided
   into the following taxonomic groups.
   
     * Fungi
     * Insects
     * Plants
     * Vertebrates
     * Other
       
   The program tfscan takes a sequence and the name of one of these
   taxonomic groups and does a fast match of the TRANSFAC sequences
   against the input sequence (optionally allowing mismatches).
   
   The results is a list of the positions which match the binding sites
   in the TRANSFAC SITE database.
   
   Because the binding sites are so small, there will be many spurious
   (false positive) matches.

   The output consists of a title line then 5 columns separated by
   whitespace.
   
   The first column is the identifier of the entry.
   
   The second column is the Accession Number of the entry.
   
   The third and fourth columns are the start and end positions of the
   match in your input sequence.
   
   The fifth column is the sequence of the region where a match has been
   found.

Data files

   tfscan reads the TRANSFAC SITE data held in the EMBOSS data files:
   
     * tffungi
     * tfinsect
     * tfplant
     * tfvertebrate
     * tfother
       
   Your EMBOSS administrator will have to run the EMBOSS program
   tfextract in order to set these files up from the TRANSFAC
   distribution files.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
   
% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
       
Notes

   None.

Warnings

   Your EMBOSS administrator will have to run the EMBOSS program
   tfextract in order to set up the data files from the TRANSFAC
   distribution files.
   
Diagnostic Error Messages

   "EMBOSS An error in tfscan.c at line 82:
   Either EMBOSS_DATA undefined or TFEXTRACT needs running"
   
   This means that you should contact your EMBOSS administrator and ask
   them to run the tfextract program to set up the TRANSFAC data for
   EMBOSS.
   
Exit status

   It always exits with a status of 0.
   
Known bugs

   None.
