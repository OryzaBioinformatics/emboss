                             Program newcpgreport
                                       
Function

   Report CpG rich areas
   
Description

   This application is used in the production of the CpG Island database
   'CPGISLE'. It produces CPGISLE database entry format reports for a
   potential CpG island.
   
   See the FTP site: ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/cpgisle/ for the
   finished database.
