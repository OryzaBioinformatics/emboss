                                Program nthseq
                                       
Function

   Writes one sequence from a multiple set of sequences
   
Description

   In EMBOSS, when an application has to write out many sequences, the
   normal style is to write them all into one file containing multiple
   sequences.
   
   This default behaviour can be changed by using the qualifier
   '-ossingle' which writes many sequences into many files, each
   containing one sequence.
   
   The program seqretsplit will take a file containing many sequences and
   will output many files, each containing one sequence. However you have
   no choice over the naming of the files - they are named after the ID
   name fo the sequence they contain.
   
   If, however you have the situation where you have a file containing
   multiple sequences and you wish to extract one of them, then this
   application may be useful.
   
   nthseq allows you to specify the name of the output file, so you may
   find that it is useful to include this program in scripts where you
   need to be able to specify the name of the resulting sequence files
   you create.
   
   This application extracts the indicated sequence from a multiple set
   of sequences and writes it out.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with nthseq.

% nthseq
Input sequence: embl:eclac*
The number of the sequence to output [1]: 2
Output sequence [eclaca.fasta]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
   -number             integer    The number of the sequence to output
  [-outseq]            seqout     Output sequence USA

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   General qualifiers:
  -help                bool       report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   -number The number of the sequence to output Integer 1 or more 1
   [-outseq]
   (Parameter 2) Output sequence USA Writeable sequence <sequence>.format
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

   A file containing one or more sequences.
   
Output file format

   The output is the specified ordinal sequence from the input USA.
   
   In the example, the second sequence from the input file will be
   written out to the specified output file.
   
Data files

   None.
   
Notes

   It may be useful to use this application in a small script that
   extracts all sequences from a multiple sequence file and explicitly
   names the output files in the way that you require.
   
   For example:
   
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
if ($#ARGV !=1) {
  die "Usage: scriptname in out\n";
}
$count=1;
@list = `infoseq $ARGV[0] -auto -only -name`;
while ($count <= $#list+1) {
  system("nthseq -auto $ARGV[0] -n $count $ARGV[1]-$count.seq");
  $count++;
}
