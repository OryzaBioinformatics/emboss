                                Program nthseq
                                       
Function

   Writes one sequence from a multiple set of sequences
   
Description

   In EMBOSS, when an application has to write out many sequences, the
   normal style is to write them all into one file containing multiple
   sequences.
   
   This default behaviour can be changed by using the qualifier
   '-ossingle' which writes many sequences into many files, each
   containing one sequence. It can also be changed by using the qualifier
   '-osf=gcg' which forces the output sequence format to be 'GCG' format
   - this format cannot cope with holding multiple sequences in one file
   and so EMBOSS writes each GCG-format sequence into its own individual
   file.
   
   If, however you have the situation where you have a file containing
   multiple sequences and you wish to extract one of them, then this
   application may be useful.
   
   This application extracts the indicated sequence from a multiple set
   of sequences and writes it out.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with nthseq.

% nthseq
Input sequence: embl:eclac*
The number of the sequence to output [1]: 2
Output sequence [eclaca.fasta]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
   -number             integer    The number of the sequence to output
  [-outseq]            seqout     Output sequence USA

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   
   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   -number The number of the sequence to output Integer 1 or more 1
   [-outseq]
   (Parameter 2) Output sequence USA Writeable sequence <sequence>.format
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

Output file format

   The output is the first, second, third, etc. sequence from the input
   USA.
   
   In the example, the search will find entries ECLACA, ECLACI, ECLACY
   and ECLACZ in that order.
   
Data files

Notes

   It may be useful to use this application in a small script that
   extracts all sequences from a multiple sequence file and explicitly
   names the output files in the way that you require.
   
   For example:
#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w
if ($#ARGV !=1) {
  die "Usage: scriptname in out\n";
}
$count=1;
@list = `infoseq $ARGV[0] -auto -only -name`;
while ($count <= $#list+1) {
  system("nthseq -auto $ARGV[0] -n $count $ARGV[1]-$count.seq");
  $count++;
}
