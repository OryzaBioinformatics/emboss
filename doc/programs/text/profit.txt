                                Program profit
                                       
Function

   Scan a sequence or database with a matrix or profile
   
Description

   profit takes a simple frequency matrix produced by prophecy and
   searches with this to find matches in the input sequence(s) you are
   searching.
   
   Scores for the matches are calculated from the simple frequency
   matrix. It is the sum of scores at each position of the matrix.
   
   A 'simple frequency matrix' is simply a count of the number of times
   any particular amino acid occurs at each position in the alignment
   used to create it. Simple frequency matrices are created using the
   program prophecy with the option '-type F' to create the correct type
   of matrix. The alignment should not have gaps in it.
   
   The resulting matrix is moved to each position in the sequence(s) you
   are searching. At each position in the sequence, the frequencies of
   the amino acids or bases covered by the length of the matrix is read
   from the matrix. The sum of these frequencies at each position of the
   matrix is the score for that position of the sequence. If this score
   is above the threshold percentage of the maximum possible score for
   that matrix, then a hit is reported.

Input file format

   It reads a simple frequency matrix produced by prophecy and searches
   one or more sequences.
   
Output file format

   The ouput is a list of three columns.
   
   The first column is the name of the matching sequence found.
   The second is the start position in the sequence of the match.
   The third column (after the word 'Percentage:') is the percentage of
   the maximum possible score (sum of the highest value at each position
   in the frequency matrix).
   
   The output from the above example follows:
     _________________________________________________________________
   
# PROF scan using simple frequency matrix mymatrix
# Scores >= threshold 75 (max score 76)

Warnings

   The aligned set of sequences used to make the simple frquency matrix
   should not have gaps in it. profit will let you use a matrix made from
   a gapped alignment, but the results will probably not be sensible.
