Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-scopin]            infile     Name of scop file for input (embl-like
                                  format)
  [-pdbtosp]           infile     Name of the pdbcodes to swissprot indexing
                                  (embl-like format)
  [-dpdb]              string     Location of clean domain coordinate files
                                  for input (embl-like format)
  [-extn]              string     File extension of clean domain coordinate
                                  files
  [-scopout]           outfile    Name of processed file for output (embl-like
                                  format)
  [-errf]              outfile    Name of log file for the build

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -datafile           matrixf    This is the scoring matrix file used when
                                  comparing sequences.
   -gapopen            float      The gap insertion penalty is the score taken
                                  away when a gap is created. The best value
                                  depends on the choice of comparison matrix.
                                  The default value assumes you are using the
                                  EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein sequences, and
                                  the EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide
                                  sequences.
   -gapextend          float      The gap extension, penalty is added to the
                                  standard gap penalty for each base or
                                  residue in the gap. This is how long gaps
                                  are penalized. Usually you will expect a few
                                  long gaps rather than many short gaps, so
                                  the gap extension penalty should be lower
                                  than the gap penalty. An exception is where
                                  one or both sequences are single reads with
                                  possible sequencing errors in which case you
                                  would expect many single base gaps. You can
                                  get this result by setting the gap open
                                  penalty to zero (or very low) and using the
                                  gap extension penalty to control gap
                                  scoring.

   General qualifiers:
  -help                boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose

   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -datafile This is the scoring matrix file used when comparing
   sequences. Comparison matrix file in EMBOSS data path EBLOSUM62
   -gapopen The gap insertion penalty is the score taken away when a gap
   is created. The best value depends on the choice of comparison matrix.
   The default value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62 matrix for
   protein sequences, and the EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide sequences.
   Floating point number from 1.0 to 100.0 10.0 for any sequence
   -gapextend The gap extension, penalty is added to the standard gap
   penalty for each base or residue in the gap. This is how long gaps are
   penalized. Usually you will expect a few long gaps rather than many
   short gaps, so the gap extension penalty should be lower than the gap
   penalty. An exception is where one or both sequences are single reads
   with possible sequencing errors in which case you would expect many
   single base gaps. You can get this result by setting the gap open
   penalty to zero (or very low) and using the gap extension penalty to
   control gap scoring. Floating point number from 0.0 to 10.0 0.5 for
   any sequence
