Function

   Gapped alignment for profiles
   
Description

   prophet finds matches between a GRIBSKOV or HENIKOFF profile produced
   by prophecy and one or more sequences.
   
   Note: prophet does NOT use the 'simple frequency matrices' produced by
   prophecy. If you have a 'simple frequency matrix'you should use the
   program profit to scan sequences.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with prophet.
   
(The sequence alignment looks like:)
% more m.seq
>one
DEVGGEA-GRLLVVYPWTQR
>two
DEVGREALGRLL-VYPWTQR
>three
DEVGGEALGRILVVY-WTQR
>four
DEVGGEAAGRVLVVYPWTQR

(Create the profile:)
% prophecy
Creates matrices/profiles from multiple alignments
Input sequence set: m.seq
Profile type
         F : Frequency
         G : Gribskov
         H : Henikoff
Select type [F]: g
Enter a name for the profile [mymatrix]:
Scoring matrix [Epprofile]:
Gap opening penalty [3.0]:
Gap extension penalty [0.3]:
Output file [outfile.prophecy]:

(Now do the search:)
% prophet
Gapped alignment for profiles
Input sequence(s): sw:*
Profile or matrix file: outfile.prophecy
Gap opening coefficient [1.0]:
Gap extension coefficient [0.1]:
Output file [100k_rat.prophet]:

Warnings

   prophet does NOT use the 'simple frequency matrices' produced by
   prophecy. If you have a 'simple frequency matrix'you should use the
   program profit to scan sequences.
   
Diagnostic Error Messages

   If you see something like:
   
   EMBOSS An error in prophet.c at line 110:
Unrecognised profile/matrix file format

   then you have probably given prophet a 'simple frequency matrix' and
   not a a GRIBSKOV or HENIKOFF profile produced by prophecy.
   
   If you see something like:
   
Uncaught exception
Allocation Failed
raised at prophet.c:147

   then you have run out of memory. This will occur if your sequence
   and/or your profile are large.
   
   prophet
   allocates space based on the length of the sequence and the size of
   the profile (8 x seqlen x profilelen)
   
Exit status

   It exists with a status of 0.
   
Known bugs

   None.
