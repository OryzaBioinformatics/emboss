                                Program prophet
                                       
Function

   Gapped alignment for profiles
   
Description

   prophet finds matches between a GRIBSKOV or HENIKOFF profile produced
   by prophecy and one or more sequences.
   
   Note: prophet does NOT use the 'simple frequency matrices' produced by
   prophecy. If you have a 'simple frequency matrix'you should use the
   program profit to scan sequences.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with prophet.
   
(The sequence alignment looks like:)
% more m.seq
>one
DEVGGEA-GRLLVVYPWTQR
>two
DEVGREALGRLL-VYPWTQR
>three
DEVGGEALGRILVVY-WTQR
>four
DEVGGEAAGRVLVVYPWTQR

(Create the profile:)
% prophecy
Creates matrices/profiles from multiple alignments
Input sequence set: m.seq
Profile type
         F : Frequency
         G : Gribskov
         H : Henikoff
Select type [F]: g
Enter a name for the profile [mymatrix]:
Scoring matrix [Epprofile]:
Gap opening penalty [3.0]:
Gap extension penalty [0.3]:
Output file [outfile.prophecy]:

(Now do the search:)
% prophet
Gapped alignment for profiles
Input sequence(s): sw:*
Profile or matrix file: outfile.prophecy
Gap opening coefficient [1.0]:
Gap extension coefficient [0.1]:
Output file [100k_rat.prophet]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   [-infile]
   (Parameter 2) Profile or matrix file Input file Required
   -gapopen Gap opening coefficient Any integer value 1.0
   -gapextend Gap extension coefficient Any integer value 0.1
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 3) Output file name Output file <sequence>.prophet
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

   It reads a GRIBSKOV or a HENIKOFF profile produced by prophecy and
   searches one or more sequences.
   
Output file format

   The output of the above example follows:
   
Data files

   None.
   
Notes

   None.
   
References

   None.
   
Warnings

   prophet does NOT use the 'simple frequency matrices' produced by
   prophecy. If you have a 'simple frequency matrix'you should use the
   program profit to scan sequences.
   
Diagnostic Error Messages

   If you see something like:
   
   EMBOSS An error in prophet.c at line 110:
Unrecognised profile/matrix file format

   then you have probably given prophet a 'simple frequency matrix' and
   not a a GRIBSKOV or HENIKOFF profile produced by prophecy.
   
Exit status

   It exists with a status of 0.
   
Known bugs

   None.
