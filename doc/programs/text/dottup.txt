                                Program dottup
                                       
Function

   Displays a wordmatch dotplot of two sequences
   
Description

   A dotplot is a graphical representation of the regions of similarity
   between two sequences.
   
   The two sequences are placed on the axes of a rectangular image and
   wherever there is a similarity between the sequences a dot is placed
   on the image.
   
   Where the two sequences have substantial regions of similarity, many
   dots align to form diagonal lines. It is therefore possible to see at
   a glance where there are local regions of similarity.
   
   dottup looks for places where words (tuples) of a specified length
   have an exact match in both sequences and draws a diagonal line over
   the position of these words.
   
   Using a longer word (tuple) size thus displays less random noise, runs
   extremely quickly, but is less sensitive.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with dottup.

% dottup embl:eclac embl:eclaci -wordsize=6 -gtitle="eclaci vs eclac"

   Here is a session writing the results to a data file:

% dottup embl:eclac embl:eclaci -wordsize=6 -text -outfile=eclac.dottup

Input file format

   Any two sequence USAs of the same type (DNA or protein).
   
Output file format

   A .ps file is created if postscipt output is requested.
   
   If an output data file is requested using the '-text' qualifier, as in
   the example usage given above, the file looks like:

2250 matches found

     ECLAC     ECLACI Length
        49           1       1113
      5510         195         12

       864        1049          9
etc.

   The first line gives the number of matching words. The next non-blank
   line is the column heading. The rest of the file is composed of three
   columns of data on the positions of matching diagonals sorted by
   length:
     * The start position in the first sequence
     * The start position in the second sequence
     * The length of the alignment

   dotmatcher, by comparison, moves a window of specified length up each
   diagonal and displays a line over the window if the sum of the
   comparisons (using a substitution matrix) exceeds a threshold. It is
   slower but much more sensitive.
