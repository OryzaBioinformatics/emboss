Function

   Displays a wordmatch dotplot of two sequences
   
Description

   A dotplot is a graphical representation of the regions of similarity
   between two sequences.
   
   The two sequences are placed on the axes of a rectangular image and
   (in the simplest forms of dotplot) wherever there is a similarity
   between the sequences a dot is placed on the image.
   
   Where the two sequences have substantial regions of similarity, many
   dots align to form diagonal lines. It is therefore possible to see at
   a glance where there are local regions of similarity as these will
   have long diagonal lines. It is also easy to see other features such
   as repeats (which form parallel diagonal lines), and insertions or
   deletions (which form breaks or discontinuities in the diagonal
   lines).
   
   dottup looks for places where words (tuples) of a specified length
   have an exact match in both sequences and draws a diagonal line over
   the position of these words. This is a fast, but not especially
   sensitive way of creating dotplots. It is an acceptable method for
   displaying regions of substantial similarity between two sequences.
   
   Using a longer word (tuple) size displays less random noise, runs
   extremely quickly, but is less sensitive. Shorter word sizes are more
   sensitive to shorter or fragmentary regions of similarity, but also
   display more random points of similarity (noise) and runs slower.

   Program name                          Description
   dotmatcher   Displays a thresholded dotplot of two sequences
   dotpath      Displays a non-overlapping wordmatch dotplot of two sequences
   polydot      Displays all-against-all dotplots of a set of sequences
   
   dotmatcher, by comparison, moves a window of specified length up each
   diagonal and displays a line over the window if the sum of the
   comparisons (using a substitution matrix) exceeds a threshold. It is
   slower but much more sensitive.
