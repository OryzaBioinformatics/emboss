Input file format

   The input is a standard EMBOSS text query.

   The major text sources defined as standard in EMBOSS installations are
   non-standard types on the srs server and databases with a "text" query
   in the Data Resource Catalogue database DRCAT.

   Data can also be read from text output in any supported text format
   written by an EMBOSS or third-party application. The text format is
   needed to identify the start and end of a single "entry" within a
   larger text file.

   The input format can be specified by using the command-line qualifier
   -format xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the name of the required
   format. The available format names are: text, html, xml (uniprotxml),
   obo, embl (swissprot)

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/TextFormats.html for further
   information on text formats.
