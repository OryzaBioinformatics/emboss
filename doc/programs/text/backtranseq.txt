     _________________________________________________________________
   
                              Program backtranseq
                                       
Function

   Back translate a protein sequence
   
Description

   Backtranseq takes a protein sequence and makes a best estimate of the
   likely nucleic acid sequence it could have come from. It does this by
   using a codon frequency table. For each amino acid, the corresponding
   most frequently occuring codon is used in the construction of the
   nucleic acid sequence.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with backtranseq.

% backtranseq
Input sequence: sw:opsd_human
Output sequence [opsd_human.fasta]:

   Here is a session using a drosophila sequence and codon table:

% backtranseq -seq sw:ach2_drome -out stdout -cfile Edrosophila

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          sequence   Sequence USA
  [-outfile]           seqout     Output sequence USA

   Optional qualifiers:
   -cfile              codon      Codon usage table name

   Advanced qualifiers: (none)

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence USA Readable sequence Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 2) Output sequence USA Writeable sequence <sequence>.format
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -cfile Codon usage table name Codon usage file in EMBOSS data path
   Ehum.cut
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

   Any DNA sequence USA.
   
Output file format

   The output is a nucleotide sequence containing the most favoured back
   translation of the specified protein, and using the specified
   translation table (which defaults to human).
   
Data files

   The codon usage table is read by default from "Ehum.cut" in the
   'data/CODONS' directory of the EMBOSS distribution. If the name of a
   codon usage file is specified on the command line, then this file will
   first be searched for in the current directory and then in the
   'data/CODONS' directory of the EMBOSS distribution.
   
   To see the available EMBOSS codon usage files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the codon usage tables (for example 'Emus.cut') into
   your current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Emus.cut

Notes

References

Warnings

Diagnostic Error Messages

   "Corrupt codon index file" - the codon usage file is incomplete or
   empty.
   
   "The file 'drosoph.cut' does not exist" - the codon usage file cannot
   be opened.
   
Exit status

   This program always exits with a status of 0, unless the codon usage
   table cannot be opened.
