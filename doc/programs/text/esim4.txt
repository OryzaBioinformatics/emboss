Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-asequence]         sequence   Sequence USA
  [-bsequence]         seqall     Genomic sequence
  [-outfile]           outfile    Output file name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -word               integer    Sets the word size (W) for blast hits.
                                  Default value: 12.
   -extend             integer    Sets the word extension termination limit
                                  (X) for the blast-like stage of the
                                  algorithm. Default value: 12.
   -cutoff             integer    Sets the cutoff (E) in range [3,10].
   -usermspa           toggle     False: esim4 calculates mspA, True: value
                                  from mspA command line argument.
*  -mspa               integer    MSP score threshold (K) for the first stage
                                  of the algorithm. (If this option is not
                                  specified, the threshold is computed from
                                  the lengths of the sequences, using
                                  statistical criteria.) For example, a good
                                  value for genomic sequences in the range of
                                  a few hundred Kb is 16. To avoid spurious
                                  matches, however, a larger value may be
                                  needed for longer sequences.
   -usermspb           toggle     False: esim4 calculates mspB, True: value
                                  from mspB command line argument.
*  -mspb               integer    Sets the threshold for the MSP scores (C)
                                  when aligning the as-yet-unmatched
                                  fragments, during the second stage of the
                                  algorithm. By default, the smaller of the
                                  constant 12 and a statistics-based threshold
                                  is chosen.
   -weight             integer    Weight value (H) (undocumented). 0 uses a
                                  default, >0 is a value
   -diagonal           integer    Bound (K) for the diagonal distance within
                                  consecutive MSPs in an exon.
   -strand             menu       This determines the strand of the genome (R)
                                  with which the mRNA will be aligned. The
                                  default value is 'both', in which case both
                                  strands of the genome are attempted. The
                                  other allowed modes are 'forward' and
                                  'reverse'.
   -format             integer    Sets the output format (A). Exon endpoints
                                  only (format=0), exon endpoints and
                                  boundaries of the coding region (CDS) in the
                                  genomic sequence, when specified for the
                                  input mRNA (-format=5), alignment text
                                  (-format=1), alignment in lav-block format
                                  (-format=2), or both exon endpoints and
                                  alignment text (-format=3 or -format=4). If
                                  a reverse complement match is found,
                                  -format=0,1,2,3,5 will give its position in
                                  the plus strand of the longer sequence and
                                  the minus strand of the shorter sequence.
                                  -format=4 will give its position in the plus
                                  strand of the first sequence (mRNA) and the
                                  minus strand of the second sequence
                                  (genome), regardless of which sequence is
                                  longer. The -format=5 option can be used
                                  with the S command line option to specify
                                  the endpoints of the CDS in the mRNA, and
                                  produces output in the exons file format
                                  required by PipMaker.
   -cliptails          boolean    Trim poly-A tails (P). Specifies whether or
                                  not the program should report the fragment
                                  of the alignment containing the poly-A tail
                                  (if found). By default (-nocliptails) the
                                  alignment is displayed as computed. When
                                  this feature is enabled (-cliptails), sim4
                                  will remove the poly-A tails and all format
                                  options will produce additional lav
                                  alignment headers.
   -smallexons         boolean    Requests an additional search for small
                                  marginal exons (N) (N=1) guided by the
                                  splice-site recognition signals. This option
                                  can be used when a high accuracy match is
                                  expected. The default value is N=0,
                                  specifying no additional search.
   -[no]ambiguity      boolean    Controls the set of characters allowed in
                                  the input sequences (B). By default
                                  (-ambiguity), ambiguity characters
                                  (ABCDGHKMNRSTVWXY) are allowed. By
                                  specifying -noambiguity, the set of
                                  acceptable characters is restricted to
                                  A,C,G,T,N and X only.
   -cdsregion          string     Allows the user to specify the endpoints of
                                  the CDS in the input mRNA (S), with the
                                  syntax: -cdsregion=n1..n2. This option is
                                  only available with the -format=5 flag,
                                  which produces output in the format required
                                  by PipMaker. Alternatively, the CDS
                                  coordinates could appear in a construct
                                  CDS=n1..n2 in the FastA header of the mRNA
                                  sequence. When the second file is an mRNA
                                  database, the command line specification for
                                  the CDS will apply to the first sequence in
                                  the file only.
   -offseta            integer    Undocumented (f) - some sort of offset in
                                  first sequence.
   -offsetb            integer    Undocumented (F) - some sort of offset in
                                  second sequence.
   -toa                integer    Undocumented (t)- offset end of first
                                  sequence?
   -tob                integer    Undocumented (T) - offset end of second
                                  sequence?

   [-bsequence]
   (Parameter 2) Genomic sequence Readable sequence(s) Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 3) Output file name Output file <sequence>.esim4
   Additional (Optional) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -word Sets the word size (W) for blast hits. Default value: 12. Any
   integer value 12
   -extend Sets the word extension termination limit (X) for the
   blast-like stage of the algorithm. Default value: 12. Any integer
   value 12
   -cutoff Sets the cutoff (E) in range [3,10]. Integer up to 10 3
   -usermspa False: esim4 calculates mspA, True: value from mspA command
   line argument. Toggle value Yes/No No
   -mspa MSP score threshold (K) for the first stage of the algorithm.
   (If this option is not specified, the threshold is computed from the
   lengths of the sequences, using statistical criteria.) For example, a
   good value for genomic sequences in the range of a few hundred Kb is
   16. To avoid spurious matches, however, a larger value may be needed
   for longer sequences. Any integer value 16
   -usermspb False: esim4 calculates mspB, True: value from mspB command
   line argument. Toggle value Yes/No No
   -mspb Sets the threshold for the MSP scores (C) when aligning the
   as-yet-unmatched fragments, during the second stage of the algorithm.
   By default, the smaller of the constant 12 and a statistics-based
   threshold is chosen. Any integer value 12
   -weight Weight value (H) (undocumented). 0 uses a default, >0 is a
   value Any integer value 0
   -diagonal Bound (K) for the diagonal distance within consecutive MSPs
   in an exon. Any integer value 10
   -strand This determines the strand of the genome (R) with which the
   mRNA will be aligned. The default value is 'both', in which case both
   strands of the genome are attempted. The other allowed modes are
   'forward' and 'reverse'.
   both    (Both strands)
   forward (Forward strand only)
   reverse (Reverse strand only)
   both
   -format Sets the output format (A). Exon endpoints only (format=0),
   exon endpoints and boundaries of the coding region (CDS) in the
   genomic sequence, when specified for the input mRNA (-format=5),
   alignment text (-format=1), alignment in lav-block format (-format=2),
   or both exon endpoints and alignment text (-format=3 or -format=4). If
   a reverse complement match is found, -format=0,1,2,3,5 will give its
   position in the plus strand of the longer sequence and the minus
   strand of the shorter sequence. -format=4 will give its position in
   the plus strand of the first sequence (mRNA) and the minus strand of
   the second sequence (genome), regardless of which sequence is longer.
   The -format=5 option can be used with the S command line option to
   specify the endpoints of the CDS in the mRNA, and produces output in
   the exons file format required by PipMaker. Integer from 0 to 5 0
   -cliptails Trim poly-A tails (P). Specifies whether or not the program
   should report the fragment of the alignment containing the poly-A tail
   (if found). By default (-nocliptails) the alignment is displayed as
   computed. When this feature is enabled (-cliptails), sim4 will remove
   the poly-A tails and all format options will produce additional lav
   alignment headers. Boolean value Yes/No No
   -smallexons Requests an additional search for small marginal exons (N)
   (N=1) guided by the splice-site recognition signals. This option can
   be used when a high accuracy match is expected. The default value is
   N=0, specifying no additional search. Boolean value Yes/No No
   -[no]ambiguity Controls the set of characters allowed in the input
   sequences (B). By default (-ambiguity), ambiguity characters
   (ABCDGHKMNRSTVWXY) are allowed. By specifying -noambiguity, the set of
   acceptable characters is restricted to A,C,G,T,N and X only. Boolean
   value Yes/No Yes
   -cdsregion Allows the user to specify the endpoints of the CDS in the
   input mRNA (S), with the syntax: -cdsregion=n1..n2. This option is
   only available with the -format=5 flag, which produces output in the
   format required by PipMaker. Alternatively, the CDS coordinates could
   appear in a construct CDS=n1..n2 in the FastA header of the mRNA
   sequence. When the second file is an mRNA database, the command line
   specification for the CDS will apply to the first sequence in the file
   only. Any string is accepted An empty string is accepted
   -offseta Undocumented (f) - some sort of offset in first sequence. Any
   integer value 0
   -offsetb Undocumented (F) - some sort of offset in second sequence.
   Any integer value 0
   -toa Undocumented (t)- offset end of first sequence? Any integer value

Author(s)

   This program is an EMBOSS conversion of a program written by Liliana
   Florea as part of the SIM4 package.

   Although we take every care to ensure that the results of the EMBOSS
   version are identical to those from the original package, we recommend
   that you check your inputs give the same results in both versions
   before publication.

   Please report all bugs in the EMBOSS version to the EMBOSS bug team,
   not to the original author.
