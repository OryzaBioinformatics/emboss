                               Program wossname
                                       
Function

   Finds programs by keywords in their one-line documentation
   
Description

   This allows a user to search for keywords or parts of words in the
   brief documentation (as displayed by a program when it first starts).
   The program name and the brief description is output. If no words to
   search for are specified, then details of all the EMBOSS programs are
   output.
   
   The program has been written on the assumption that most people will
   use it to quickly find the name of a program based on that program's
   description, so the output goes to the screen by default.
   
   This program may find some use in automatically generating lists of
   EMBOSS programs and their groups for Web pages.
   
Usage

   Here are some sample sessions with wossname.

        Search for programs with 'restrict' in their description
        % wossname restrict

        Display a listing of programs in their groups
        % wossname -search ''

        Display an alphabetic listing of all programs
        % wossname -search '' -alphabetic

        Display only the groups that the programs can belong to
        % wossname -search '' -groups
        
        Output html tags around the list of program groups
        % wossname '' -groups -html -prelink '#'

        Output html tags around the list of programs
        % wossname '' -html -prelink
          'http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/' -postlink '.shtml'

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-search]            string     Enter a word or words here and a
                                  case-independent search for it will be made
                                  in the one-line documentation of all of the
                                  EMBOSS programs. If no keyword is specified,
                                  all programs will be listed.

   Optional qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -outfile            outfile    If you enter the name of a file here then
                                  this program will write the program names
                                  and brief descriptions into that file.
   -html               bool       If you are sending the output to a file,
                                  this will format it for displaying as a
                                  table in a WWW document.
*  -prelink            string     If you are outputting to a file in HTML
                                  format, you can make the program names into
                                  hyper-links by setting this to be the first
                                  half of the URL.
                                  For example, if you wish the program name to
                                  be a hyperlink to the URL:
                                  http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/
programname.shtml
                                  then if you enter
                                  http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/
                                  here, then the first half of the URL before
                                  the programname will be set.
*  -postlink           string     If you are outputting to a file in HTML
                                  format, you can make the program names into
                                  hyper-links by setting this to be the second
                                  half of the URL.
                                  For example, if you wish the program name to
                                  be a hyperlink to the URL:
                                  http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/
programname.shtml
                                  then if you enter '.shtml' here, the second
                                  half of the URL after the programname will
                                  be set.
   -groups             bool       If you use this option, then only the group
                                  names will output to the file
   -alphabetic         bool       If you use this option, then you will get a
                                  single list of the program names and
                                  descriptions instead of the programs being
                                  listed in their functional groups.
   -explode            bool       The groups that EMBOSS applications belong
                                  to have two forms, exploded and not
                                  exploded. The exploded group names are more
                                  numerous and often vaguely phrased than the
                                  non-exploded ones. The exploded names are
                                  formed from definitions of the group names
                                  that start like NAME1:NAME2 and which are
                                  then expanded into many combinations of the
                                  names as: 'NAME1', 'NAME2', 'NAME1 NAME2',
                                  NAME2 NAME1'. The non-expanded names are
                                  simply like: 'NAME1 NAME2'.

   Advanced qualifiers:
   -[no]emboss         bool       If you use this option then EMBOSS program
                                  documentation will be searched. If this
                                  option is set to be false, then only the
                                  EMBASSY programs will be searched (if the
                                  -embassy option is true). EMBASSY programs
                                  are not strictly part of EMBOSS, but use the
                                  same code libraries and share the same look
                                  and feel, but are generally developed by
                                  people who wish the programs to be outside
                                  of the GNU Public Licence sheme, ie. they
                                  may wish to charge money for them.
   -[no]embassy        bool       If you use this option then EMBASSY program
                                  documentation will be searched. If this
                                  option is set to be false, then only the
                                  EMBOSS programs will be searched (if the
                                  -emboss option is true). EMBASSY programs
                                  are not strictly part of EMBOSS, but use the

   will be searched. If this option is set to be false, then only the
   EMBASSY programs will be searched (if the -embassy option is true).
   EMBASSY programs are not strictly part of EMBOSS, but use the same

   Yes/No Yes
   
Input file format

   The program reads the brief descriptions and the program groups from
   the ACD files. (ACD files control the parameters that the programs
   expect - don't worry about them unless you are writing EMBOSS
   programs).
   
   The format of ACD files is documented elsewhere.
   
Output file format

   The results are written out as a simple list preceded by the group
   that the programs belong to or the word that is being searched for.
   e.g.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% wossname 'rest'
SEARCH FOR 'REST'
redata           Isoschizomers, references and suppliers for restriction enzyme
s
restrict         Finds restriction enzyme cleavage sites
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   If the -html, -prelink and -postlink qualifiers are specified, then
   the output will be wrapped in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web
   page. Note that tags such as <HTML>, <BODY>, </BODY> and </HTML> are
   not output by this program as the list of programs is expected to form
   only part of the contents of a web page - the rest of the web page
   must be supplied by the user.
   
Data files

   As noted above, the program ACD files are searched. The average user
   will not need to worry about this.
   
Notes

   If a program's ACD file does not assign the program to a group, it
   will be automatically assigned to the group 'ASSORTED'.
   
   A program can belong to more than one group.
   
   The name of this program comes from its use as a favorite word of the
   author Terry Pratchett. It is used especially by the characters of the
   parrot in Eric and the dog Gaspode in Moving Pictures and Men at Arms.
