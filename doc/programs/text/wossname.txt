Function

   Finds programs by keywords in their one-line documentation
   
Description

   This allows a user to search for keywords or parts of words in the
   brief documentation (as displayed by a program when it first starts).
   The program name and the brief description is output. If no words to
   search for are specified, then details of all the EMBOSS programs are
   output.
   
   The program has been written on the assumption that most people will
   use it to quickly find the name of a program based on that program's
   description, so the output goes to the screen by default.
   
   This program may find some use in automatically generating lists of
   EMBOSS programs and their groups for Web pages.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with wossname
   
   Search for programs with 'restrict' in their description:
   

% wossname restrict 
Finds programs by keywords in their one-line documentation

SEARCH FOR 'RESTRICT'

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -explode            boolean    The groups that EMBOSS applications belong

                                  non-exploded ones. The exploded names are
                                  formed from definitions of the group names
                                  that start like NAME1:NAME2 and which are
                                  then expanded into many combinations of the

*  -prelink            string     If you are outputting to a file in HTML
                                  format, you can make the program names into
                                  hyper-links by setting this to be the first
                                  half of the URL.
                                  For example, if you wish the program name to
                                  be a hyperlink to the URL:
                                  http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Apps
/programname.html
                                  then if you enter

                                  here, then the first half of the URL before
                                  the programname will be set.
*  -postlink           string     If you are outputting to a file in HTML
                                  format, you can make the program names into
                                  hyper-links by setting this to be the second
                                  half of the URL.
                                  For example, if you wish the program name to
                                  be a hyperlink to the URL:
                                  http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Apps
/programname.html
                                  then if you enter '.html' here, the second
                                  half of the URL after the programname will
                                  be set.

                                  names will output to the file
   -alphabetic         boolean    If you use this option, then you will get a
                                  single list of the program names and
                                  descriptions instead of the programs being
                                  listed in their functional groups.

Input file format

   wossname reads the brief descriptions and the program groups from the
   ACD files. (ACD files control the parameters that the programs expect
   - don't worry about them unless you are writing EMBOSS programs).
   
   The format of ACD files is documented elsewhere.
   
Output file format

   The results are written out as a simple list preceded by the group
   that the programs belong to or the word that is being searched for.

   If the -html, -prelink and -postlink qualifiers are specified, then
   the output will be wrapped in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web
   page. Note that tags such as <HTML>, <BODY>, </BODY> and </HTML> are
   not output by this program as the list of programs is expected to form
   only part of the contents of a web page - the rest of the web page
   must be supplied by the user.
   
Data files

   As noted above, the program ACD files are searched. The average user
   will not need to worry about this.
   
Notes

   If a program's ACD file does not assign the program to a group, it
   will be automatically assigned to the group 'ASSORTED'.
   
   A program can belong to more than one group.
   
   The name of this program comes from its use as a favorite word of the
   author Terry Pratchett. It is used especially by the characters of the
   parrot in Eric and the dog Gaspode in Moving Pictures and Men at Arms.
