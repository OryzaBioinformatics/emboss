Function

   Codon usage statistics
   
Description

   Calculates Frank Wright's Nc statistic for the effective number of
   codons used (ref 1).
   
   The Nc statistic has problems in very short sequences (20 amino acids
   or less) which are yet to be fully resolved. They are caused by the
   need to consider amino acids which are missing in the sequence.
   
   This calculation was originally in the EGCG package as "codfish"
   (codon usage for fission yeast). As Frank Wright is a vegan, we looked
   for a meat-free name for the EMBOSS version, "chips". The official
   explanation is "Codon Heterozygosity (Inverse of) in a Protein-coding
   Sequence"
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with chips. If the sequence extends beyond
   the coding region then the start and/or end positions of the CDS must
   be provided because chips analyses exclusively protein coding regions.

   -window             integer    Averaging window


   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-seqall]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 2) Output file name Output file <sequence>.chips
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default

Input file format

Output file format

   This is the output from the example run:

# CHIPS codon usage statistics

Nc = 32.951

   If all codons are used, the Nc value will be 61. If only one codon is
   used for each amino acid the Nc value will be 20. Low values therefor
   indicate a strong codon bias, and high values indicate a low bias and
   possibly a non-coding region.
   
Data files

   chips reads a codon usage file but only as a template and ignores the
   original data.
   
   The codon usage table is by default the file "CODONS/Ehum.cut" in the
   EMBOSS distribution directory.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
