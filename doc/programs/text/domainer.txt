Function

   Build domain coordinate files
   
Description

   Nearly all proteins have structural similarities with other proteins
   and, in some of these cases, share a common evolutionary origin. A
   knowledge of these relationships is crucial to our understanding of
   the evolution of proteins and of development. It will also play an
   important role in the analysis of the sequence data that is being
   produced by worldwide genome projects.
   
   The SCOP database aims to provide a detailed and comprehensive
   description of the structural and evolutionary relationships between
   all proteins whose structure is known, including all entries in the
   Protein Data Bank (PDB).
   
   domainer reads in an EMBL-like format SCOP classification file
   generated by the EMBOSS applications scope or nrscope, and EMBL-like
   format clean protein coordinate files generated by the coorde
   application. (not currently in EMBOSS, email Jon Ison
   jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk) For each domain in the scop classification file
   domainer writes clean domain coordinate files in EMBL-like and PDB
   formats. Each of these output files contains coordinates for a single
   SCOP domain. In cases where multiple models were determined, the data
   in the domain files correspond to the first model. In the rare cases
   where a domain is comprised of more than one chain, the data will be
   presented as belonging to a single chain (i.e. a single sequence,
   chain identifier etc will be given).

Input file format

   The EMBL-like format used for the input clean protein data (and the
   output domain format) uses the following records:
   
   (1) ID - Either the 4-character PDB identifier code (for clean protein
   coordinate files) or the 7-character domain identifier code taken from
   scop (for domain coordinate files; see documentation for the EMBOSS
   application scope for further info.)
   
   (2) DE - compound information. Text from the COMPND records from the
   original pdb file are given.
   
   (3) OS - protein source information. Text from the SOURCE records from
   the original pdb file are given.
   
   (4) EX - experimental information. The text 'nmr_or_model' (for
   nuclear magnetic resonance and model structures) or 'xray' (for
   structures determined by X-ray crystallography) appears as appropriate
   after the text 'METHOD'. The resolution of X-ray structures, or '0'
   for structures of type 'nmr_or_model', is given after 'RESO'. The
   number of models and number of polypeptide chains are given after
   'NMOD' and 'NCHA' respectively. For domain coordinate files a 1 is
   always given. Following the EX record, the file will have a section
   containing a CN, IN and SQ records (see below) for each chain.
   
   (5) CN - chain number. The number given in brackets after this record
   indicates the start of a section of chain-specific data.
   
   (6) IN - chain specific data. The character given after ID is the PDB
   chain identifier (a '.' is given in cases where a chain identifier was
   not specified in the pdb file or, for domain coordinate files, the
   domain is comprised of more than one domain). The number of amino acid
   residues comprising the chain (or the chains from which a domain is
   comprised) is given after NR. The number of atoms in heterogens and
   water molecules are given after NH and NW respectively. Domain
   coordinate files do not include coordinates for these groups so a
   value of 0 is always given.
   
   (7) SQ - protein sequence. The number of residues is given before AA
   on the first line. The protein sequence is given on subsequent lines.
   
   (8) CO - coordinate data. The columns of the records are as follows.
    1. CO is always given.
    2. Model number (always 1 for domain coordinate files).
    3. Chain number (always 1 for domain coordinate files).
    4. Either P (a protein atom), H (a heterogen atom) or W (an atom in a
       water molecule).
    5. Position of the residue in the protein sequence given in the SQ
       record (for protein atoms) or a sequential count of the atoms (for
       heterogens and water).
    6. Residue number according to the original pdb file, or or a
       sequential count of the atoms (for heterogens and water).
    7. Single character amino acid code or a '.' (for heterogens and
       water).
    8. 3-character residue identifier code.
    9. Atom type.
   10. The x orthogonal coordinate.
   11. The y orthogonal coordinate.
   12. The z orthogonal coordinate.
   13. Occupancy.
   14. Temperature factor.
       
   (9) XX - Used for spacing.
   
   (10) // - Given on the last line of the file only.
   
Output file format

   The PDB format is explained at:
   http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/docs/format/pdbguide2.2/guide2.2_frame.html
   domainer writes the following records in PDB format:
   
   (1) HEADER - bibliographic information. The text 'CLEANED-UP PDB FILE
   FOR SCOP DOMAIN XXXXXXX' is always given (where XXXXXXX is a
   7-character domain identifier code).
   
   (2) TITLE - bibliographic information. The text ' THIS FILE IS MISSING
   MOST RECORDS FROM THE ORIGINAL PDB FILE' is always given.
   
   (3) COMPND - compound information. The COMPND records from the
   original pdb file are given.
   
   (4) SOURCE - protein source information. The SOURCE records from the
   original PDB file are given.
   
   (5) REMARK - remark records. Remark records are used for spacing. One
   REMARK line containing the protein resolution is always given.
   
   (6) SEQRES - protein sequence.
   
   (7) ATOM - atomic coordinates.
   
   (8) TER - indicates the end of a chain.
   
   The following is an example of an excerpt from an output clean domain
   coordinate file (PDB format):

   domainer also writes out the clean domain coordinate files in
   EMBL-like format. The format for this EMBL-like data is described in
   the Input File format section of this document as it used the same
   format for the input clean protein EMBL-like data and the output clean
   domain EMBL-like data.

   domainer generates a log file, an excerpt of which is shown below. If
   there is a problem in processing a domain, three lines containing the
   record '//', the domain identifier code and an error message
   respectively are written. The text 'WARN filename not found' is given
   in cases where a clean coordinate file could not be found. 'ERROR
   filename file read error' or 'ERROR filename file write error' will be
   reported when an error was encountered during a file read or write
   respectively. Various other error messages may also be given (in case
   of difficulty email Jon Ison, jison@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk).
