Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-seqpairsdir]       dirlist    Input directory of files containing sequence
                                  pairs for alignment
  [-commandpath]       directory  Directory where alignment executable lives
  [-commandname]       string     Name of alignment executable
  [-scoringmatrixdir]  directory  Directory where scoring matrix lives
  [-scoringmatrixname] string     Name of alignment scoring matrix
   -gapopen            float      The gap opening penalty is subtracted from
                                  the total score every time a gap is inserted
                                  in the alignment. The default value is
                                  chosen for the EBLOSUM62 scoring matrix when
                                  you are aligning protein sequences, and the
                                  EDNAFULL matrix when you are aligning
                                  nucleotide sequences. If you sequence
                                  contains many small errors you should set a
                                  low gap opening penalty (near zero) to avoid
                                  over-penalizing those errors.
   -gapextend          float      The gap extension penalty is the score
                                  substracted when more spaces are added to an
                                  existing alignment gap. Often a single
                                  insertion or deletion affects multiple
                                  residues/nucleotides; separate opening and
                                  extension penalties reduce the excessive
                                  penalty such events would otherwise carry;
                                  generally the gap extension penalty should
                                  be significantly lower than the gap opening
                                  penalty.
  [-alignedseqsoutdir] outdir     Name of directory containing sequences
                                  aligned by nawalign
  [-outfilesuffix]     string     Appended to end of all output alignment file
                                  names
  [-outfileformat]     string     Format of output alignments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-seqpairsdir]
   (Parameter 1) Input directory of files containing sequence pairs for
   alignment Directory with files .
   [-commandpath]
   (Parameter 2) Directory where alignment executable lives Directory
   [-commandname]
   (Parameter 3) Name of alignment executable Any string is accepted
   nawalign
   [-scoringmatrixdir]
   (Parameter 4) Directory where scoring matrix lives Directory
   [-scoringmatrixname]
   (Parameter 5) Name of alignment scoring matrix Any string is accepted
   EBLOSUM62
   -gapopen The gap opening penalty is subtracted from the total score
   every time a gap is inserted in the alignment. The default value is
   chosen for the EBLOSUM62 scoring matrix when you are aligning protein
   sequences, and the EDNAFULL matrix when you are aligning nucleotide
   sequences. If you sequence contains many small errors you should set a
   low gap opening penalty (near zero) to avoid over-penalizing those
   errors. Floating point number from 1.0 to 100.0 10.0 for any sequence
   -gapextend The gap extension penalty is the score substracted when
   more spaces are added to an existing alignment gap. Often a single
   insertion or deletion affects multiple residues/nucleotides; separate
   opening and extension penalties reduce the excessive penalty such
   events would otherwise carry; generally the gap extension penalty
   should be significantly lower than the gap opening penalty. Floating
   point number from 0.0 to 10.0 0.5 for any sequence
   [-alignedseqsoutdir]
   (Parameter 6) Name of directory containing sequences aligned by
   nawalign Output directory
   [-outfilesuffix]
   (Parameter 7) Appended to end of all output alignment file names Any
   string is accepted .nawalign

   (Parameter 8) Format of output alignments Any string is accepted fasta
