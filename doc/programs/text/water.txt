Function

   Smith-Waterman local alignment
   
Description

   Uses the smith-waterman algorithm (modified for speed enhancments) to
   calculate the local alignment.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with water.

% water sw:hba_human sw:hbb_human
Gap opening penalty [10.0]:
Gap extension penalty [0.5]:
Output file [hba_human.water]:

Output file format

Data files

   For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution matrix.
   For nucleotide sequence, EDNAMAT is used. Others can be specified.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
