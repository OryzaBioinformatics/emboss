Function

   Smith-Waterman local alignment of sequences

Description

   water uses the Smith-Waterman algorithm (modified for speed
   enhancments) to calculate the local alignment of a sequence to one or
   more other sequences. The gap insertion penalty, gap extension penalty
   and substitution matrix used to calculate the alignments are specified.
   The output is a standard EMBOSS alignment file.

  Algorithm

   The Smith-Waterman algorithm is a member of the class of algorithms
   that can calculate the best score and local alignment in the order of
   mn steps, where n and m are the lengths of the two sequences. These
   dynamic programming algorithms were first developed for protein
   sequence comparison by Smith and Waterman, though similar methods were
   independently devised during the late 1960's and early 1970's for use
   in the fields of speech processing and computer science.

   Dynamic programming methods ensure the optimal local alignment by
   exploring all possible alignments and choosing the best. It does this
   by reading in a scoring matrix that contains values for every possible
   residue or nucleotide match. water finds an alignment with the maximum
   possible score where the score of an alignment is equal to the sum of
   the matches taken from the scoring matrix.

   An important problem is the treatment of gaps, i.e., spaces inserted to
   optimise the alignment score. A penalty is subtracted from the score
   for each gap opened (the 'gap open' penalty) and a penalty is
   subtracted from the score for the total number of gap spaces multiplied
   by a cost (the 'gap extension' penalty). Typically, the cost of
   extending a gap is set to be 5-10 times lower than the cost for opening
   a gap.

   There are two ways to compute a penalty for a gap of n positions : gap
   opening penalty + (n - 1) * gap extension penalty gap penalty + n * gap
   length penalty

   The two methods are basically equivalent. The first way is used by
   EMBOSS and WU-BLAST. The second way is used by NCBI-BLAST, GCG, Staden
   and CLUSTAL. Fasta used it for a long time the first way, but Prof.
   Pearson decided recently to shift to the second.

   The Smith-Waterman algorithm contains no negative scores in the path
   matrix it creates. The algorithm starts the alignment at the highest
   path matrix score and works backwards until a cell contains zero. See
   the Reference Smith et al. for details.

Command line arguments

Smith-Waterman local alignment of sequences
Version: EMBOSS:6.3.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-asequence]         sequence   Sequence filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input USA)
  [-bsequence]         seqall     Sequence(s) filename and optional format, or
                                  reference (input USA)
   -gapopen            float      [10.0 for any sequence] The gap open penalty
                                  is the score taken away when a gap is
                                  created. The best value depends on the
                                  choice of comparison matrix. The default
                                  value assumes you are using the EBLOSUM62
                                  matrix for protein sequences, and the
                                  EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide sequences.
                                  (Number from 0.000 to 100.000)
   -gapextend          float      [0.5 for any sequence] The gap extension
                                  penalty is added to the standard gap penalty
                                  for each base or residue in the gap. This
                                  is how long gaps are penalized. Usually you
                                  will expect a few long gaps rather than many
                                  short gaps, so the gap extension penalty
                                  should be lower than the gap penalty. An
                                  exception is where one or both sequences are
                                  single reads with possible sequencing
                                  errors in which case you would expect many
                                  single base gaps. You can get this result by
                                  setting the gap open penalty to zero (or
                                  very low) and using the gap extension
                                  penalty to control gap scoring. (Number from
                                  0.000 to 10.000)

                                  file 'EBLOSUM62' (for proteins) or the file
                                  'EDNAFULL' (for nucleic sequences). These

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS alignment file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -aformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. Some of the alignment formats can cope
   with an unlimited number of sequences, while others are only for pairs
   of sequences.

   The available multiple alignment format names are: unknown, multiple,
   simple, fasta, msf, trace, srs

   The available pairwise alignment format names are: pair, markx0,
   markx1, markx2, markx3, markx10, srspair, score

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/AlignFormats.html for further
   information on alignment formats.

   The Identity: is the percentage of identical matches between the two
   sequences over the reported aligned region (including any gaps in the
   length).

   The Similarity: is the percentage of matches between the two sequences
   over the reported aligned region (including any gaps in the length).

Data files

   For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution matrix.
   For nucleotide sequence, EDNAFULL is used. Others can be specified.

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat


   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata". Files
   for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or again
   in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

Notes

   A local alignment searches for regions of local similarity between two
   sequences and need not include the entire length of the sequences.
   Local alignment methods are very useful for scanning databases or other
   circumsatnces when you wish to find matches between small regions of
   sequences, for example between protein domains.

Warnings

   Local alignment methods only report the best matching areas between two
   sequences - there may be a large number of alternative local alignments
   that do not score as highly. If two proteins share more than one common
   region, for example one has a single copy of a particular domain while
   the other has two copies, it may be possible to "miss" the second and
   subsequent alignments. You will be able to see this situation if you
   have done a dotplot and your local alignment does not show all the
   features you expected to see.

   water is for aligning the best matching subsequences of two sequences.
   It does not necessarily align whole sequences against each other; you
   should use needle if you wish to align closely related sequences along
   their whole lengths.

   A true Smith Waterman implementation like water needs memory
   proportional to the product of the sequence lengths. For two sequences
   of length 10,000,000 and 1,000 it therefore needs memory proportional
   to 10,000,000,000 characters. Two arrays of this size are produced, one
   of ints and one of floats so multiply that figure by 8 to get the
   memory usage in bytes. That doesn't include other overheads. Therefore
   only use water and needle for accurate alignment of reasonably short
   sequences. It should not be used with very large sequences unless you
   have a lot of memory and a lot of time. If you run out of memory, try
   using supermatcher or matcher instead.

Diagnostic Error Messages

Uncaught exception
 Assertion failed
 raised at ajmem.c:xxx

   Probably means you have run out of memory. Try using supermatcher or
   matcher if this happens.

Exit status

   0 if successful.

   matcher is a local alignment program that gives as good an alignment as

   water
   but it uses far less memory. However,

   water
   runs twice as fast as matcher.

   supermatcher is designed for local alignments of very large sequences.
   It gives good results as long as there is not significant amounts of
   insertion or deletion in the alignment.
