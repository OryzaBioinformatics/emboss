Version: EMBOSS:6.4.0.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-oboterms]          obo        Obo term filename and optional format, or

Input file format

   The input is a standard EMBOSS ontology query.

   The major ontology sources defined as standard in EMBOSS installations
   are EDAM, GO (gene Ontology) and SO (Sequence Ontology).

   Data can also be read from ontology output in "obo" format written by
   an EMBOSS application.

  Input files for usage example

  Database entry: edam:0001234

[Term]
id: EDAM:0001234

t do not (typically) correspond to common sequence database records or database
entries.
subset: data
