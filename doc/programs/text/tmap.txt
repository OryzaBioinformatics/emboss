Description

   This program predicts transmembrane segments in proteins, utilising
   the algorithm described in: "Persson, B. & Argos, P. (1994) Prediction
   of transmembrane segments in proteins utilising multiple sequence
   alignments J. Mol. Biol. 237, 182-192."
   
   tmap reads in one or more aligned protein sequences.
   
   Two sets of propensity values are then used for the calculations: one
   for the middle, hydrophobic portion and one for the terminal regions
   of the transmembrane sequence spans. Average propensity values are
   calculated for each position along the alignment, with the
   contribution from each sequence weighted according to its
   dissimilarity relative to the other alignged sequences.
   
   Eight-residue segments are considered as potential cores of
   transmembrane segments and elongated if thier middle propensity values
   are above a threshold. End propensity values are also considered as
   stop signals. Only helices with a length of 15 to 29 residues are
   allowed and correctionbs for strictly conserved charged residues are
   made.
   
   The method is more successful than predictions based upon single
   sequences alone.
   
   The results are plotted on a graph and written to a text file.

Input file format

   Any protein sequence USA for one or more aligned sequences.
   
Output file format

   A plot of the propensities to form the middle and the end of
   transmembrane regions is output.
   
   Bars are displayed in the plot above the regions predicted as being
   most likely to form transmembrane regions.
   
   The text file (specified by the -output option) gives a summary of
   these regions. The text file produced by the above example is:

Program TMAP, version 46, to predict transmembrane segments from .msf file.
The program reads a multiple alignment file of the GCG multiple sequence format
and predicts membrane-spanning regions according to the algorithm in
Persson & Argos (1994), J. Mol. Biol. 237, 182-192.

RESULTS from program TMAP, edition 46'

Numbers give: a) number of transmembrane segment
              b) start of TM segment (alignment position / residue number)
              c) end of TM segment (alignment position / residue number)
              d) length of TM segment within parentheses

   The transmembrane regions for the complete alignment are given first,
   followed by the predictions for each individual sequence in the
   alignment. (In the example above there is only 1 sequence in the
   alignment.)
