Function

   Displays membrane spanning regions
   
Description

   This program predicts transmembrane segments in proteins, utilising
   the algorithm described in: "Persson, B. & Argos, P. (1994) Prediction
   of transmembrane segments in proteins utilsing multiple sequence
   alignments J. Mol. Biol. 237, 182-192."
