Function

   Protein statistics
   
Description

   pepstats outputs a report of simple protein sequence information
   including:
   
     * molecular weight
     * number of residues
     * average residue weight
     * charge
     * isoelectric point
     * for each type of amino acid: number, molar percent, DayhoffStat
     * for each physico-chemical class of amino acid: number, molar
       percent
       
   DayhoffStat is the amino acid's Dayhoff statistic divided by the molar
   percent. The Dayhoff statistic is the amino acid's relative occurence
   per 1000 aa normalised to 100 by rls@ebi.ac.uk (original work from
   1993)

Data files

   The Dayhoff statistic is read from the EMBOSS data file
   'Edayhoff.freq'. You can inspect and modify this file by copying it
   into your current directory with the command: 'embossdata -fetch'.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
