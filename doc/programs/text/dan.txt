Function

   Calculates DNA RNA/DNA melting temperature
   
Description

   Dan calculates the melting temperature (Tm) and the percent G+C of a
   nucleic acid sequence (optionally plotting them). For the Melting
   temperature profile, free energy values calculated from nearest
   neighbor thermodynamics are used (Breslauer et al. Proc. Natl. Acad.
   Sci. USA 83, 3746-3750 and Baldino et al. Methods in Enzymol. 168,
   761-777).

Output file format

   If a plot is not being produced, dan reports the sequence of each
   oligomer window, its melting temperature under the specified
   conditions and its GC content.
   
   The output is a standard EMBOSS report file.
   
   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -rformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: embl,
   genbank, gff, pir, swiss, trace, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq, excel,
   feattable, motif, regions, seqtable, simple, srs, table, tagseq
   
   See:
   http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Themes/ReportFormats.html for
   further information on report formats.
   
   By default dan writes a 'seqtable' report file.
   
   This is the start and the end of the output file from the example.

Data files

   The EMBOSS data files "Edna.melt" and "Erna.melt" are used to read in
   the entropy/enthalpy/energy data for DNA and RNA respectively.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
