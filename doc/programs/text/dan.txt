Function

   Calculates DNA RNA/DNA melting temperature
   
Description

   Dan calculates the melting temperature (Tm) and the percent G+C of a
   nucleic acid sequence (optionally plotting them). For the Melting
   temperature profile, free energy values calculated from nearest
   neighbor thermodynamics are used (Breslauer et al. Proc. Natl. Acad.
   Sci. USA 83, 3746-3750 and Baldino et al. Methods in Enzymol. 168,
   761-777).

                                  determined by taking a short length of
                                  sequence known as a window and determining

etc.

   The first non-blank line is the title containing the program name, the
   sequence name and the start and end positions of the sequence to be
   considered.
   
   Subsequent lines contain columns of data for each window into the
   sequence as it is moved along, giving:
   
     * The start postion of the window
     * The sequence of the window
     * The end position of the window
     * The melting temperature of the window
     * The percentage C+G of the window
       
   If the qualifier '-product' is used to make the program prompt for
   percent formamide percent of mismatches allowed and product length,
   then the output includes the melting temperature of the specified
   product:

Data files

   The EMBOSS data files "Edna.melt" and "Erna.melt" are used to read in
   the entropy/enthalpy/energy data for DNA and RNA respectively.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
