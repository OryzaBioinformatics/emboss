                                Program revseq
                                       
Function

   Reverse and complement a sequence
   
Description

   This takes a sequence and outputs the reverse complement (also known
   as the anti-sense or reverse sense) sequence.
   
   It can also output just the reversed sequence or just the complement
   of the sequence.
   
Usage

   To create the reverse sense of the sequence 'rcr.seq' and output to
   the file 'rcr.rev':
% revseq rcr.seq rcr.rev

   To create the complement of the sequence 'rcr.seq' and output to the
   file 'rcr.rev':
% revseq rcr.seq rcr.rev -norev

   To create the reverse of the sequence 'rcr.seq' and output to the file
   'rcr.rev':
% revseq rcr.seq rcr.rev -nocomp
