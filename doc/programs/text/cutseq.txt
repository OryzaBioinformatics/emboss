                                Program cutseq
                                       
Function

   Removes a specified section from a sequence
   
Description

   This simple editing program allows you to cut out a region from your
   sequence by specifying the begin and end positions of the sequence to
   remove.
   
Usage

   To remove bases 10 to 12 from a sequence 'gatta.seq' and write to the
   new sequence file 'gatta2.seq':
% cutseq gatta.seq gatta2.seq -from=10 -to=12

   To remove the first 20 bases from 'hatta.seq' and write it to
   'jsh.seq':
% cutseq -seq=hatta.seq -from=1 -to=20 -out=jsh.seq
