                                Program cutseq
                                       
Function

   Removes a specified section from a sequence
   
Description

   This simple editing program allows you to cut out a region from your
   sequence by specifying the begin and end positions of the sequence to
   remove.
   
   It removes the sequence from the specified start to the end positions
   (inclusive) and returns the rest of the sequence in the output file.
   
Usage

   To remove bases 10 to 12 from a sequence 'gatta.seq' and write to the
   new sequence file 'gatta2.seq':
% cutseq gatta.seq gatta2.seq -from=10 -to=12

   To remove the first 20 bases from 'hatta.seq' and write it to
   'jsh.seq':
% cutseq -seq=hatta.seq -from=1 -to=20 -out=jsh.seq
