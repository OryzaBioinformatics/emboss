Function

   Displays all-against-all dotplots of a set of sequences
   
Description

   A dotplot is a graphical representation of the regions of similarity
   between two sequences.
   
   The two sequences are placed on the axes of a rectangular image and
   (subject to threshold conditions) wherever there is a similarity
   between the sequences a dot is placed on the image.
   
   Where the two sequences have substantial regions of similarity, many
   dots align to form diagonal lines. It is therefore possible to see at
   a glance where there are local regions of similarity.
   
   polydot compares all sequences in a set of sequences, draws a dotplot
   for each pair of sequences by marking where words (tuples) of a
   specified length have an exact match in both sequences and optionally
   reports all identical matches to feature files.
   
Usage

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-sequences]         seqset     File containing a sequence alignment
   -wordsize           integer    Word size
*  -graph              graph      Graph type
*  -outfile            outfile    Output file name

   Optional qualifiers:
   -[no]boxit          bool       Draw a box around each dotplot
   -dumpfeat           bool       Dump all matches as feature files
   -format             string     format to Dump out as
   -ext                string     Extension for feature file

   Advanced qualifiers:
   -data               bool       Output the match data to a file instead of
                                  plotting it
   -gap                integer    This specifies the size of the gap that is
                                  used to separate the individual dotplots in
                                  the display. The size is measured in
                                  residues, as displayed in the output.
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default

   -ext Extension for feature file Any string is accepted gff
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -data Output the match data to a file instead of plotting it Yes/No No
