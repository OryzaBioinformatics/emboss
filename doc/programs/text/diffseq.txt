                                Program diffseq
                                       
Function

   Find differences (SNPs) between nearly identical sequences
   
Description

   diffseq takes two overlapping, nearly identical sequences and reports
   the differences between them, together with any features that overlap
   with these regions. GFF files of the differences in each sequence are
   also produced.
   
   diffseq should be of value when looking for SNPs, differences between
   strains of an organism and anything else that requires the differences
   between sequences to be highlighted.
   
   The sequences can be very long. The program does a match of all
   sequence words of size 10 (by default). It then reduces this to the
   minimum set of overlapping matches by sorting the matches in order of
   size (largest size first) and then for each such match it removes any
   smaller matches that overlap. The result is a set of the longest
   ungapped alignments between the two sequences that do not overlap with
   each other. The mismatched regions between these matches are reported.
   
   It should be possible to find differences between sequences that are
   Mega bytes long.

  __________________________________________________________________________

   The first line is the title giving the names of the sequences used.
   
   The next two non-blank lines state the positions in each sequence
   where the detected overlap between them starts.
   
   There then follows a set of reports of the mismatches between the
   sequences.
   Each report consists of 4 or more lines.
     * The first line has the name of the first sequence followed by the
       start and end positions of the mismatched region in that sequence,
       followed by the length of the mismatched region. If the mismatched
       region is of zero length in this sequence, then only the position
       of the last matching base before the mismatch is given.
     * If a feature of the first sequence overlaps with this mismatch
       region, then one or more lines starting with 'Feature:' comes next
       with the type, position and tag field of the feature.
     * Next is a line starting "Sequence:" giving the sequence of the
       mismatch in the first sequence.
       
   This is followed by the equivalent information for the second
   sequence, but in the reverse order, namely 'Sequence:' line,
   'Feature:' lines and line giving the position of the mismatch in the
   second sequence.
   
   At the end of the report are two non-blank lines giving the positions
   in each sequence where the detected overlap between them ends.
   
   The last three lines of the report gives the counts of SNPs (defined
   as a change of one nucleotide to one other nucleotide, no deletions or
   insertions are counted, no multi-base changes are counted).
   
   The counts of transitions (Pyrimide to Pyrimidine or Purine to Purine)
   and transversions (Pyrimidine to Purine) are also given.
   
   It should be noted that not all features are reported.
   
   The 'source' feature found in all EMBL/Genbank feature table entries
   is not reported as this covers all of the sequence and so overlaps
   with any difference found in that sequence and so is uninformative and
   irritating. It has therefore been removed from the output report.
   
   The translation information of CDS features is often extremely long
   and does not add useful information to the report. It has therefore
   been removed from the output report.
   
   If no regions of alignment are found, the following output is given:
  __________________________________________________________________________

# Report of diffseq of: Fred and ECOMPA



No regions of alignment found.
  __________________________________________________________________________

   If the -columns qualifier is given then the output is given in a
   columnar format.
   
   The columns are separated by one or more spaces or TAB characters in
   the order:
   
     * sequence 1 start
     * sequence 1 end
     * sequence 1 length
     * sequence 1 sequence in quotes
     * sequence 2 start
     * sequence 2 end
     * sequence 2 length
     * sequence 2 sequence in quotes
       
   Note: no features are reported in this format in order to keep the
   columns lining up nicely.
   
   For example:

Notes

   It should be noted that not all features are reported.
   
   The 'source' feature found in all EMBL/Genbank feature table entries
   is not reported as this covers all of the sequence and so overlaps
   with any difference found in that sequence and so is uninformative and
   irritating. It has therefore been removed from the output report.
   
   The translation information of CDS features is often extremely long
   and does not add useful information to the report. It has therefore
   been removed from the output report.
   
   If you run out of memory, use a larger word size.
   
   Using a larger word size increases the length between mismatches that
   will be reported as one event. Thus a word size of 50 will report two
   SNP that are with 50 bases of each other as one mismatch.
