Function

   Finds MAR/SAR sites in nucleic sequences
   
Description

   Matrix/scaffold attachment regions (MARs/SARs) are genomic elements
   thought to delineate the structural and functional organisation of the
   eukaryotic genome. Originally, MARs and SARs were identified through
   their ability to bind to the nuclear matrix or scaffold. Binding
   cannot be assigned to a unique sequence element, but is dispersed over
   a region of several hundred base pairs. These elements are found
   flanking a gene or a small cluster of genes and are located often in
   the vicinity of cis-regulatory sequences. This has led to the
   suggestion that they contribute to higher order regulation of
   transcription by defining boundaries of independently controlled
   chromatin domains. There is indirect evidence to support this notion.
   In transgenic experiments MARs/SARs dampen position effects by
   shielding the transgene from the effects of the chromatin structure at
   the site of integration. Furthermore, they may act as boundary
   elements for enhancers, restricting their long range effect to only
   the promoters that are located in the same chromatin domain.
   
   marscan finds a bipartite sequence element that is unique for a large
   group of eukaryotic MARs/SARs. This MAR/SAR recognition signature
   (MRS) comprises two individual sequence elements that are <200 bp
   apart and may be aligned on positioned nucleosomes in MARs. The MRS
   can be used to correctly predict the position of MARs/SARs in plants
   and animals, based on genomic DNA sequence information alone.
   Experimental evidence from the analysis of >300 kb of sequence data
   from several eukaryotic organisms show that wherever a MRS is observed
   in the DNA sequence, the corresponding genomic fragment is a
   biochemically identifiable SAR.
   
   The MRS is a bipartite sequence element that consists of two
   individual sequences of 8 (AATAAYAA) and 16 bp (AWWRTAANNWWGNNNC)
   within a 200 bp distance from each other. One mismatch is allowed in
   the 16 bp pattern. The patterns can occur on either strand of the DNA
   with respect to each other. The 8 bp and the 16 bp sites can overlap.
   
   Where there are many possible MRS sites caused by many 8 bp and/or 16
   bp pattern sites located within 200 bp of each other, then only the 8
   bp site and the 16 bp site that occur closest to each other are
   reported.
   
   Once a MRS has been reported, no more sites will be looked for within
   200 bp of that site. This reduces (but maybe will not totally
   eliminate) over-reporting of the clusters of MRS's that tend to occur
   within a MAR/SAR.
   
   Not all SARs contain a MRS. Analysis of >300 kb of genomic sequence
   from a variety of eukaryotic organisms shows that the MRS faithfully
   predicts 80% of MARs and SARs, suggesting that at least one other type
   of MAR/SAR may exist which does not contain a MRS.
