Function

   Extract data from CUTG
   
Description

   given the name of a directory containing the CUTG database
   (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/cutg) this will calculate codon
   usage tables for individual species (e.g. EHomo_sapiens.cut) and place
   them in the CODONS subdirectory of the EMBOSS data directory. This is
   an all-or-nothing extraction, will create many files and take several
   minutes. The usage tables are from the sum of codons over all
   sequences for each organism. Given the name of a directory containing
   the CUTG database (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/cutg) cutgextract
   will calculate codon usage tables for individual species (e.g.
   EHomo_sapiens.cut) and place them in the CODONS subdirectory of the
   EMBOSS data directory. This is an all-or-nothing extraction, will
   create many files and take several minutes. The usage tables are from
   the sum of codons over all sequences for each organism.
   
   The EMBOSS distribution comes loaded with a set of codon usage tables.
   Thes codon usage tables provided with the distribution are calculated
   from the files in
   ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/codonusage/README), with a few
   additions whose exact derivation cannot easily be determined. Many
   people would prefer to create their own from the public CUTG data.
   
   You run cutgextract on the CUTG database from
   ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/cutg. You should get all the
   required *.codon files from CUTG, and uncompress them if they are
   compressed before running cutgextract on them.
   
   The task of downloading the CUTG database and running cutgextract to
   create the codon usage table files from it would normally be done only
   once when the EMBOSS package is being installled or if a new version
   of the CUTG database is released.
   
   Note by the way that CUTG has a drawback: it has a table for each
   organism without making the distinction between different gene
   populations.
   
Algorithm

   cutgextract looks in the specified directory and opens all the files
   with the extension '.codon'. These are all expected to be CUTG data
   files.
   
   It then parses out the codon usage data from these *.codon files and
   writes one file per species into the EMBOSS data/CODONS directory. The
   names of the files are derived from the species names in the CUTG
   files. These files names will be long (and therefore descriptive).

Input file format

Output file format

   cutgextract outputs a set of EMBOSS codon usage data files to the
   EMBOSS data/CODONS data directory
   
Output files for usage example

File: CODONS

Data files

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
   
% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
