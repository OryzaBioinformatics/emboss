Function

   Extract data from CUTG

Description

   Given the name of a directory containing the CUTG database
   (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/cutg) cutgextract will calculate
   codon usage tables for individual species (e.g. EHomo_sapiens.cut) and
   place them in the CODONS subdirectory of the EMBOSS data directory.
   This is an all-or-nothing extraction, will create many files and take
   several minutes. The usage tables are from the sum of codons over all
   sequences for each organism.

   The EMBOSS distribution comes loaded with a set of codon usage tables.
   Thes codon usage tables provided with the distribution are calculated
   from the files in
   ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/codonusage/README), with a few
   additions whose exact derivation cannot easily be determined. Many
   people would prefer to create their own from the public CUTG data.

   You run cutgextract on the CUTG database from
   ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/cutg. You should get all the
   required *.codon files from CUTG, and uncompress them if they are
   compressed before running cutgextract on them.

   The task of downloading the CUTG database and running cutgextract to
   create the codon usage table files from it would normally be done only
   once when the EMBOSS package is being installled or if a new version
   of the CUTG database is released.

   Note by the way that CUTG has a drawback: it has a table for each
   organism without making the distinction between different gene
   populations.

Algorithm

   cutgextract looks in the specified directory and opens all the files
   with the extension '.codon'. These are all expected to be CUTG data
   files.

   It then parses out the codon usage data from these *.codon files and
   writes one file per species into the EMBOSS data/CODONS directory. The
   names of the files are derived from the species names in the CUTG
   files. These files names will be long (and therefore descriptive).
