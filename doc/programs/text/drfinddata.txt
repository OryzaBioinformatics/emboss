Function

   Find public databases by data type

Description

   drfinddata searches the Data Resource Catalogue to find entries with
   EDAM data terms matching a query string.

Algorithm

   The first search is of the EDAM ontology data namespace, using the term
   names and their synonynms. All child terms are automatically included
   in the set of matches inless the -nosubclasses qualifier is used.

   The -sensitive qualifier also searches the definition strings.

   The set of EDAM terms are then compared to entries in the Data Resource
   Catalogue, searching the 'edat' EDAM data index.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with drfinddata


% drfinddata virus
Find public databases by data type
Data resource output file [drfinddata.drcat]:


   Go to the output files for this example

Command line arguments

Find public databases by data type
Version: EMBOSS:6.4.0.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-query]             string     List of EDAM data keywords (Any string)
  [-outfile]           outresource [*.drfinddata] Output data resource file
                                  name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -sensitive          boolean    [N] By default, the query keywords are
                                  matched against the EDAM term names (and
                                  synonyms) only. This option also matches the
                                  keywords against the EDAM term definitions
                                  and will therefore (typically) report more
                                  matches.
   -[no]subclasses     boolean    [Y] Extend the query matches to include all
                                  terms which are specialisations (EDAM
                                  sub-classes) of the matched type.

   Associated qualifiers:

   "-outfile" associated qualifiers
   -odirectory2        string     Output directory
   -oformat2           string     Data resource output format

   General qualifiers:
   -auto               boolean    Turn off prompts
   -stdout             boolean    Write first file to standard output
   -filter             boolean    Read first file from standard input, write
                                  first file to standard output
   -options            boolean    Prompt for standard and additional values
   -debug              boolean    Write debug output to program.dbg
   -verbose            boolean    Report some/full command line options
   -help               boolean    Report command line options and exit. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   -warning            boolean    Report warnings
   -error              boolean    Report errors
   -fatal              boolean    Report fatal errors
   -die                boolean    Report dying program messages
   -version            boolean    Report version number and exit


Input file format

   None.

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS resource file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -oformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: drcat,
   basic, wsbasic, list.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/ResourceFormats.html for further
   information on resource formats.
