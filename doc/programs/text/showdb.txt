Function

   Displays information on the currently available databases
   
Description

   This writes out a simple table displaying the names, contents and
   available ways of accessing the sequence databases.
   
   The available ways of accessing the databases are 'ID', 'Query' and
   'All'. These refer to the way that you can search the databases to get
   entries from them, which is governed by the ways the database has been
   set up and the way it is organised and indexed.
   
   Different databases may have different access capabilities, depending
   on how your local site is organised.
   
   EMBOSS has been designed to be extremely flexible in its use of
   sequence databases formats, so that it is easy to set EMBOSS up to use
   your site's existing databases. Sometimes this means that it is hard
   to extract entries from some databases in particular ways. For
   example, a flat file database with no index is only useful for reading
   all entries, while a database located in another site that is
   available via the WWW may only provide single entries.
   
   'ID' (also known as 'single entry') allows the programs to extract a
   single explicitly named entry from the database, for example
   embl:x13776
   
   'Query' (also known as 'wild') indicates that programs can extract a
   set of matching wildcard entry names (this may be slow for some
   methods of access). For example you can look at all of the human PAX
   proteins in SWISS_PROT by: swissprot:pax*_human
   
   'All' allows the programs to analyse all the entries in the database
   sequentially. For example this lets you look at all entries in the
   database with the notation: embl:*
   
   A database may have several different methods of access available.
   Ideally all of the databases available on your site will be available
   in all three ways, but this is not the best of all posssible worlds
   and so you might like to check how you can access the databases by
   running this program and having a look.

   The output is a simple table.
   
   Type 'P' indicates that this is a Protein database.
   
   Type 'N' indicates that this is a Nucleic database.
   
   'OK' under ID, Qry or All indicates that that access method can be
   used on this database. A '-' indicates that you cannot access this
   database in that way.
   
   Note that 'OK' does not mean that the database is working correctly.
   It simply means that showdb has read the database definition correctly
   and that this method of access to the database should be possible.
   
   If you are setting up a new database, then you should check that it
   works correctly by extracting entries from it using seqret.
   
   When the -html qualifier is specified, then the output will be wrapped
   in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web page. Note that tags such
   as <HTML>, <BODY>, </BODY> and </HTML> are not output by this program
   as the table of databases is expected to form only part of the
   contents of a web page - the rest of the web page must be supplied by
   the user.
   
Data files

   The databases are specified in the files "emboss.defaults" for site
   wide definitions, and "~/.embossrc" for the user's own settings.
   
Notes

   Note that 'OK' in the output does not mean that the database is
   working correctly. It simply means that showdb has read the database
   definition correctly and that this method of access to the database
   should be possible.
   
   If you are setting up a new database, then you should check that it
   works correctly by extracting entries from it using seqret.
   
   You can set up your own private databases by editing a file called
   '.embossrc' to contain database specifications.
   
   You can set up public databases by editing the file
   '/usr/local/share/EMBOSS/emboss.default' (if you have the permission
   to do this).
   
   The 'emboss.default' file will already have the definitions of the
   test databases in: tsw, tembl, tpir, etc. These are the databases that
   are used in the examples shown in the documentation of the programs.
   
   For details of the database definitions, you should first read David's
   Administration Guide:
   http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Doc/Admin_guide/adminguide/
   especially:
   http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Doc/Admin_guide/adminguide/no
   de4.html 
   
   See also: http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Usa/databases.html
   for a lot of detail of the syntax of database definition.
   
   Just because showdb can display the database definitions, it does NOT
   mean that the databases are set up correctly. You must now test them
   using seqret.

   None.
   
Warnings

   None.
   
Diagnostic Error Messages

   "The database 'xyz' does not exist" You have supplied the name of a
   database with the -database qualifier, but that database does not
   exist as far as EMBOSS is concerned.
   
Exit status

   It always exits with status 0, unless the above diagnostic message is
   displayed.
   
Known bugs

   None noted.
