                                  infoseq 
                                      
   
   
Function

   Displays some simple information about sequences
   
Description

   This is a small utility to list the sequences' USA, name, accession
   number, type (nucleic or protein), length, percentage C+G, and/or
   description.
   
   Any combination of these types of information can be easily selected
   or unselected.
   
   By default, the output file starts each line with the USA of the
   sequence being described, so the output file is a list file that can
   be manually edited and read in by any other EMBOSS program that can
   read in one or more sequence to be analysed.
   
Usage

   Display information on a sequence

% infoseq embl:paamir

   Don't display the USA of a sequence

% infoseq embl:paamir -nousa

   Display only the name and length of a sequence

% infoseq embl:paamir -only -name -length

   Display only the description of a sequence

% infoseq embl:paamir -only -desc

   Display the type of a sequence

% infoseq embl:paamir -only -type

   Display information formatted with HTML

% infoseq embl:paamir -html

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA

   Optional qualifiers:
   -outfile            outfile    If you enter the name of a file here then
                                  this program will write the sequence details
                                  into that file.
   -html               boolean    Format output as an HTML table

   Advanced qualifiers:
   -only               boolean    This is a way of shortening the command line
                                  if you only want a few things to be
                                  displayed. Instead of specifying:
                                  '-nohead -noname -noacc -notype -nopgc
                                  -nodesc'
                                  to get only the length output, you can
                                  specify
                                  '-only -length'
   -heading            boolean    Display column headings
   -usa                boolean    Display the USA of the sequence
   -name               boolean    Display 'name' column
   -accession          boolean    Display 'accession' column
   -gi                 boolean    Display 'GI' column
   -version            boolean    Display 'version' column
   -type               boolean    Display 'type' column
   -length             boolean    Display 'length' column
   -pgc                boolean    Display 'percent GC content' column
   -description        boolean    Display 'description' column

   General qualifiers:
  -help                boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -outfile If you enter the name of a file here then this program will
   write the sequence details into that file. Output file stdout
   -html Format output as an HTML table Yes/No No
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -only This is a way of shortening the command line if you only want a
   few things to be displayed. Instead of specifying: '-nohead -noname
   -noacc -notype -nopgc -nodesc' to get only the length output, you can
   specify '-only -length' Yes/No No
   -heading Display column headings Yes/No @(!$(only))
   -usa Display the USA of the sequence Yes/No @(!$(only))
   -name Display 'name' column Yes/No @(!$(only))
   -accession Display 'accession' column Yes/No @(!$(only))
   -gi Display 'GI' column Yes/No No
   -version Display 'version' column Yes/No No
   -type Display 'type' column Yes/No @(!$(only))
   -length Display 'length' column Yes/No @(!$(only))
   -pgc Display 'percent GC content' column Yes/No @(!$(only))
   -description Display 'description' column Yes/No @(!$(only))
   
Input file format

   Any sequence(s).
   
Output file format

   The output is displayed on the screen (stdout) by default.
   
   A typical output file is:
     _________________________________________________________________

     _________________________________________________________________
   
   The first non-blank line is the heading. This is followed by one line
   per sequence containing the following columns of data separated by one
   of more space or TAB characters:
     * The USA (Uniform Sequence Address) that EMBOSS can use to read in
       the sequence.
     * The name or ID of the sequence. If this is not known then '-' is
       output.
     * The accession number. If this is not known then '-' is output.
     * The type ('N' is nucleic, 'P' is protein).
     * The sequence length.
     * The description line of the sequence. This may be blank.
       
   If qualifiers to inhibit various columns of information are used, then
   the remaining columns of information are output in the same order as
   shown above, so if '-nolength' is used, the order of output is: usa,
   name, accession, type, description.
   
   When the -html qualifier is specified, then the output will be wrapped
   in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web page. Note that tags such
   as <HTML> and <BODY> are not output by this program as the table of
   databases is expected to form only part of the contents of a web page
   - the rest of the web page must be supplier by the user.
   
   The lines of out information are guaranteed not to have trailing
   white-space at the end.
   
Data files

   None.
   
Notes

   This program was written to make it easier to get some specific bits
   of information on a sequence for use in small perl scripts. This Perl
   code fragment to get the type of a sequence is typical:
$type = `$PATH_TO_EMBOSS/infoseq $sequence -auto -only -type`;
chomp $type;

   You may find other uses for it, of course.
   
   By default, the output file starts each line with the USA of the
   sequence being described, so the output file is a list file that can
   be manually edited and read in by other EMBOSS programs using the
   list-file specification of '@filename'.
