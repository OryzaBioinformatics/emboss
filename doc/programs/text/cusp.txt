                                 Program cusp
                                       
Function

   Create a codon usage table
   
Description

   Reads one or more coding sequences (CDS sequence only) and calculates
   a codon frequency table.
   
   The output file can be used as a codon usage table in other
   applications.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with cusp, using just one sequence. Normal
   use would be to extract a set of coding sequences and to use these as
   input.

% cusp -sbeg 135 -send 1292
Create a codon usage table
Input sequence: embl:paamir
Output file [paamir.cusp]:

Input file format

Output file format

   Here is the start of the output from the example run, which used a
   single CDS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa which has a very high GC
   content ands a strong coding bias, as shown by the codons for Alanine
   where those ending with G or C are used almost exclusively.

# CUSP codon usage file
# Codon Amino acid      Fract   /1000   Number
GCA     A               0.077   7.772   3
GCC     A               0.462   46.632  18
GCG     A               0.462   46.632  18
GCT     A               0.000   0.000   0

.........

   The 'Fract' column gives the faction of all amino acids coded for by
   this codon triplet.
   
   The /1000 column represents the number of codons, given the input
   sequence(s), there are per 1000 bases. This will be an extrapolation
   if the sequence is shorter than 1000 bases.
   
   If multiple sequences are input then the statistics are given for all
   of the sequences together, not individually.
   
Data files

   cusp reads a codon usage file, but only as a template and does not use
   any of the data so any file will give the same results.
