1.0 SUMMARY

   Search a DCF file for secondary structure matches

2.0 INPUTS & OUTPUTS

   Reads a DCF file (domain classification file) and a file of secondary
   structure (query) and writes DCF files containing the top-scoring
   matches (domains) between the query and domains from the DCF file. The
   secondary strructure file contains a (1) secondary structure element
   map (a string where each character represents a secondary structure
   element) and (2) a secondary structure string (each character
   represents an amino acid residue) for a given query. Matches are found
   by global alignment of (1) element maps and (2) strings (individual
   residues) to generate the two DCF (output) files.
   The DCF input file must contain domain secondary structure
   information, which can be added by using DOMAINSSE.
   The names of the secondary structure file, DCF files (input and
   output) and number of top-scoring matches to report are specified by
   the user. A log file is also written.

3.0 INPUT FILE FORMAT

   Domain classification file
   The format of the DCF file is described in the SCOPPARSE
   documentation.
   The DCF input file must contain domain secondary structure
   information, which can be added by using DOMAINSSE.
   Secondary structure file
   The format of the secondary structure file (Figure 1) is identical to
   the SS and SE records from a DCF file (see DOMAINSSE documentation.).
   The records are as follows:
     * (1) SS - Secondary structure assignment (per residue). A
       simplified 3-state assignment: H (helix), E (extended, beta
       strand) and L (loop, open coil) should be used.
     * (2) SE - Secondary structure element assignment (per secondary
       structure element). The same 3-state assignment as for the SS
       record should be used.

   Note that if the file contains secondary structure characters other
   than H, E and L they will be converted before they are used by
   SSEMATCH (see NOTES below).

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-ssinfile]          infile     This option specifies the name of the file
                                  of secondary structure (input).
  [-dcfinfile]         infile     This option specifies the name of the DCF
                                  file (domain classification file) (input). A
                                  'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like). The files are generated by
                                  using SCOPPARSE and CATHPARSE. Domain
                                  sequence information can be added to the
                                  file by using DOMAINSEQS.
   -maxhits            integer    This option specifies the number of
                                  top-scoring matches to report.
  [-outssfile]         outfile    This option specifies the name of the file
                                  containing top-scoring domains for
                                  residue-based alinnment (output).A 'domain
                                  classification file' contains classification
                                  and other data for domains from SCOP or
                                  CATH, in DCF format (EMBL-like).
  [-outsefile]         outfile    This option specifies the name of the file
                                  containing top-scoring domains for secondary
                                  structure element-based alinnment (output).
                                  A 'domain classification file' contains
                                  classification and other data for domains
                                  from SCOP or CATH, in DCF format
                                  (EMBL-like).
   -logfile            outfile    This option specifies the name of the
                                  ssematch log file (output).

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -datafile           matrixf    This option specifies the secondary
                                  structure substitution matrix.
   -gapopenr           float      This options specifies the gap insertion
                                  penalty for reside-based alignment. The gap
                                  insertion penalty is the score taken away
                                  when a gap is created. The best value
                                  depends on the choice of comparison matrix.
                                  The default value assumes you are using the
                                  EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein sequences, and
                                  the EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide
                                  sequences.
   -gapextendr         float      This options specifies the gap extension
                                  penalty for residue-based alignment. The gap
                                  extension, penalty is added to the standard
                                  gap penalty for each base or residue in the
                                  gap. This is how long gaps are penalized.
                                  Usually you will expect a few long gaps
                                  rather than many short gaps, so the gap
                                  extension penalty should be lower than the
                                  gap penalty.
   -gapopene           float      This options specifies the gap insertion
                                  penalty for element-based alignment. The gap
                                  insertion penalty is the score taken away
                                  when a gap is created. The best value
                                  depends on the choice of comparison matrix.
                                  The default value assumes you are using the
                                  EBLOSUM62 matrix for protein sequences, and
                                  the EDNAFULL matrix for nucleotide
                                  sequences.
   -gapextende         float      This options specifies the gap extension
                                  penalty for secondary structure
                                  element-based alignment. The gap extension,
                                  penalty is added to the standard gap penalty
                                  for each base or residue in the gap. This
                                  is how long gaps are penalized. Usually you
                                  will expect a few long gaps rather than many
                                  short gaps, so the gap extension penalty
                                  should be lower than the gap penalty.

7.0 KNOWN BUGS & WARNINGS

   The SSEMATCH implementation of secondary structure mapping is the most
   basic and more powerful algorithms are available. Input file
   The DCF input file must contain domain secondary structure
   information, which can be added by using DOMAINSSE.

8.0 NOTES

   Conversion of secondary structure file
   SSEMATCH currently only works with 3-state secondary structure
   assignments. The following conversions are applied to the characters
   in the secondary structure input file:
     * Bridge B/b, turn T, coil C are changed to 'L'.
     * Helices 'H', 'G', 'I' are changed to / remain 'H'.
     * Extended conformation ('E') remains 'E'.

9.0 DESCRIPTION

   Secondary structure element mapping is a coarse but powerful approach
   for identifying similarities between protein sequences. SSEMATCH
   implements a very basic approach whereby a query sequence of secondary
   structure (of elements or residues) is scanned against a library of
   known secondary structures for domains in SCOP or CATH, as held in a
   DCF file (domain classification file).

10.0 ALGORITHM

   Standard N&W-type global alignment.
