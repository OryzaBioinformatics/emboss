Function

   Find EDAM ontology terms by name

Description

   edamname searches the names and synonyms of EDAM terms and returns
   matching terms. The input is read from the installed EDAM database. The
   ontology term output can be written to screen, to file, or passed to
   another program. A wide range of standard ontology term formats may be
   specified for input and output.

   Optionally the search can be restricted to specified EDAM namespaces.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with edamname


% edamname "*sequence_set*"
Find EDAM ontology terms by name
Obo output file [edamname.obo]:


   Go to the output files for this example

   Example 2


% edamname "*sequence_set*" -subclasses

Command line arguments

Find EDAM ontology terms by name
Version: EMBOSS:6.6.0.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-query]             string     Name(s) to search for in ontology (Any
                                  string)
  [-outfile]           outobo     [*.edamname] Output ontology term file name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -namespace          menu       [*] By default all terms are returned.
                                  Searches can be limited to one or a few
                                  namespaces. (Values: data (Data entity);
                                  entity (Biological entity); format (Data
                                  format); identifier (Identifier); operation
                                  (Bioinformatics operation); resource (Data
                                  resource); topic (Field of bioinformatics
                                  study))

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -subclasses         boolean    [N] Extend the query matches to include all
                                  terms which are specialisations (EDAM
                                  sub-classes) of the matched type.
   -obsolete           boolean    [N] The default behaviour is to not use or
                                  return obsolete terms. This option if set
                                  will include all terms.

   Associated qualifiers:

   "-outfile" associated qualifiers
   -odirectory2        string     Output directory
   -oformat2           string     Ontology term output format

   General qualifiers:
   -auto               boolean    Turn off prompts
   -stdout             boolean    Write first file to standard output
   -filter             boolean    Read first file from standard input, write
                                  first file to standard output
   -options            boolean    Prompt for standard and additional values
   -debug              boolean    Write debug output to program.dbg
   -verbose            boolean    Report some/full command line options
   -help               boolean    Report command line options and exit. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   -warning            boolean    Report warnings
   -error              boolean    Report errors
   -fatal              boolean    Report fatal errors

   -version            boolean    Report version number and exit


Input file format

   edamname queries the EDAM ontology.

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS ontology term file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -oformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: obo,
   brief, list, html, xml, json, excel.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/OntologyFormats.html for further
   information on ontology formats.
