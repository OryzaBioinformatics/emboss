Function

   Retrieve information from REBASE restriction enzyme database

Description

   redata searches the REBASE database for information on a specified
   restriction enzyme. It writes an output file with information on the
   cut site and (optionally) the full list of isoschizomers (enzymes with
   the same target sequence), commercial suppliers of the enzyme and
   literature references.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with redata

Data files

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat


   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata". Files
   for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or again
   in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

   The EMBOSS REBASE restriction enzyme data files are stored in directory
   'data/REBASE/*' under the EMBOSS installation directory.

   These files must first be set up using the program 'rebaseextract'.
   Running 'rebaseextract' may be the job of your system manager.

   The data files are stored in the REBASE directory of the standard
   EMBOSS data directory. The names are:
     * embossre.enz Cleavage information
     * embossre.ref Reference/methylation information
     * embossre.sup Supplier information

   The column information is described at the top of the data files

   The reported enzyme from any one group of isoschizomers (the prototype)
   is specified in the REBASE database and the information is held in the
   data file 'embossre.equ'. You may edit this file to set your own
   preferred prototype, if you wish.

   The format of the file "embossre.equ" is
   Enzyme-name Prototype-name

   i.e. two columns of enzyme names separated by a space. The first name
   of the pair of enzymes is the name that is not preferred and the second
   is the preferred (prototype) name.

Notes

   The Restriction Enzyme database (REBASE) is a collection of information
   about restriction enzymes and related proteins. It contains published
   and unpublished references, recognition and cleavage sites,
   isoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation sensitivity,
   crystal and sequence data. DNA methyltransferases, homing
   endonucleases, nicking enzymes, specificity subunits and control
   proteins are also included. More recently, putative DNA
   methyltransferases and restriction enzymes, as predicted from analysis
   of genomic sequences, are also listed.

   The home page of REBASE is: http://rebase.neb.com/

Warnings

   redata uses the EMBOSS REBASE restriction enzyme data files stored in
   directory data/REBASE/* under the EMBOSS installation directory. These
   files must first be set up using the program rebaseextract. Running
   rebaseextract may be the job of your system manager.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.

Exit status

   It always exits with a status of 0.
