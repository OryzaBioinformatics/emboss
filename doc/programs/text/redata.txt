                                Program redata
                                       
Function

   Search REBASE for enzyme name, references, suppliers etc
   
Description

   The Restriction Enzyme database (REBASE) is a collection of
   information about restriction enzymes and related proteins. It
   contains published and unpublished references, recognition and
   cleavage sites, isoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation
   sensitivity, crystal and sequence data. DNA methyltransferases, homing
   endonucleases, nicking enzymes, specificity subunits and control
   proteins are also included. Most recently, putative DNA
   methyltransferases and restriction enzymes, as predicted from analysis
   of genomic sequences, are also listed.
   
   The home page of REBASE is: http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebase.html
   
   This program searches the REBASE database for information on a
   specified restriction enzyme.
   
   It outputs a report including the cut site, isoschizomers, references
   and commercial suppliers of the enzyme.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with redata.

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-enzyme]            string     Enter the name of the restrcition enzyme
                                  that you wish to get details of. The names
                                  often have a 'I' in them - this is a capital
                                  'i', not a '1' or an 'l'. The names are
                                  case-indeppendent ('AaeI' is the same as
                                  'aaei')
  [-outfile]           outfile    Output file name

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -[no]isoschizomers  bool       Show other enzymes with this specificity.
                                  (Isoschizomers)
   -[no]references     bool       Show references
   -[no]suppliers      bool       Show suppliers
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-enzyme]
   (Parameter 1) Enter the name of the restrcition enzyme that you wish
   to get details of. The names often have a 'I' in them - this is a
   capital 'i', not a '1' or an 'l'. The names are case-indeppendent
   ('AaeI' is the same as 'aaei') Any string is accepted BamHI
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 2) Output file name Output file <sequence>.redata
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -[no]isoschizomers Show other enzymes with this specificity.
   (Isoschizomers) Yes/No Yes
   -[no]references Show references Yes/No Yes
   -[no]suppliers Show suppliers Yes/No Yes

Output file format

   Here is the output from the example run. It includes the full list of
   isoschizomers (enzymes with the same target sequence), suppliers and
   references from the REBASE database.

Data files

   This uses the EMBOSS REBASE data files in 'data/REBASE/*' under the
   EMBOSS installation directory.
   
   These files must first be set up using the program 'rebaseextract'.
   Running 'rebaseextract' may be the job of your system manager.
