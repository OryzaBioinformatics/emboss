Description

   The Restriction Enzyme database (REBASE) is a collection of
   information about restriction enzymes and related proteins. It
   contains published and unpublished references, recognition and
   cleavage sites, isoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation
   sensitivity, crystal and sequence data. DNA methyltransferases, homing
   endonucleases, nicking enzymes, specificity subunits and control
   proteins are also included. Most recently, putative DNA
   methyltransferases and restriction enzymes, as predicted from analysis
   of genomic sequences, are also listed.
   
   The home page of REBASE is: http://rebase.neb.com/
   
   This program searches the REBASE database for information on a
   specified restriction enzyme.
   
   It outputs a report including the cut site, isoschizomers, references
   and commercial suppliers of the enzyme.

                                  often have a 'I' in them - this is a capital

Data files

   This uses the EMBOSS REBASE data files in 'data/REBASE/*' under the
   EMBOSS installation directory.
   
   These files must first be set up using the program 'rebaseextract'.
   Running 'rebaseextract' may be the job of your system manager.
