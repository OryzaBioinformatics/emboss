                              Program dotmatcher
                                       
Function

   Displays a thresholded dotplot of two sequences
   
Description

   A dotplot is a graphical representation of the regions of similarity
   between two sequences.
   
   The two sequences are placed on the axes of a rectangular image and
   (subject to threshold conditions) wherever there is a similarity
   between the sequences a dot is placed on the image.
   
   Where the two sequences have substantial regions of similarity, many
   dots align to form diagonal lines. It is therefore possible to see at
   a glance where there are local regions of similarity as these will
   have long diagonal lines. It is also easy to see other features such
   as repeats (which form parallel diagonal lines), and insertions or
   deletions (which form breaks or discontinuities in the diagonal
   lines).
   
   dotmatcher uses a threshold to define whether a match is plotted
   (calculated from the substitution matrix). A window of specified
   length is moved up all possible diagonals and a score is calculated
   within each window for each position along the diagonals. The score is
   the sum of the comparisons of the two sequences using the given
   similarity matrix along the window. If the score is above the
   threshold, then a line is plotted on the image over the position of
   the window.

   EDNAFULL for DNA
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -data Output the match data to a file instead of plotting it Yes/No No
   
Input file format

   Any 2 sequence USAs of the same type (DNA or protein).
   
Output file format

   An image is output to the requested graphics device.
   
Data files

   It uses the specified matrix substitution file to compare the two
   sequences.
   
   For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution matrix.
   For nucleotide sequence, EDNAFULL is used. Others can be specified.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

   Program name                          Description
   dotpath      Displays a non-overlapping wordmatch dotplot of two sequences
   dottup       Displays a wordmatch dotplot of two sequences
   polydot      Displays all-against-all dotplots of a set of sequences
   
   dottup, by comparison, has no threshold, using a wordmatch-style
   method. dottup is less sensitive, but substantially faster than
   dotmatcher.
