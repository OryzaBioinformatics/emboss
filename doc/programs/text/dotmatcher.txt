                              Program dotmatcher
                                       
Function

   Displays a thresholded dotplot of two sequences
   
Description

   A dotplot is a graphical representation of the regions of similarity
   between two sequences.
   
   The two sequences are placed on the axes of a rectangular image and
   (subject to threshold conditions) wherever there is a similarity
   between the sequences a dot is placed on the image.
   
   Where the two sequences have substantial regions of similarity, many
   dots align to form diagonal lines. It is therefore possible to see at
   a glance where there are local regions of similarity.
   
   dotmatcher uses a threshold to define whether a match is plotted
   (calculated from the substitution matrix). A window of specified
   length is moved up all possible diagonals and a score is calculated
   within each window for each position along the diagonals. The score is
   the sum of the comparisons of the two sequences using the given
   similarity matrix along the window. If the score is above the
   threshold, then a line is plotted on the image over the position of
   the window.
