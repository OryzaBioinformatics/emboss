Function

   Draws linear maps of DNA constructs

Description

   lindna draws linear maps of DNA constructs. It uses the graphical
   shapes ticks, ranges, and blocks to represent genetic markers (e.g,
   genes and ESTs) and places them according to their position in a DNA
   fragment. The markers can be organized in different groups. It reads an
   input file containing the names and positions of the genetic markers,
   and data for controlling the appearance of the markers (drawing
   commands). The output is a plot with with the linear DNA map.

   Blank lines in the input file are ignored.

   The file is organized in several fields separated by one or more space
   or TAB characters.

   The first non-blank line gives the start position of the DNA fragment
   to be drawn after the keyword 'Start'. The end position is on the
   second line following the keyword 'End'.

   Then, one or more groups (up to a maximum of 20) of genetic markers are
   defined. Each group begins with a line consisting of the keyword
   'group' and ends with a line consisting of the keyword 'endgroup'.

   If desired, a group name can be given on the very next line. Spaces and
   tabulations are allowed but only the first 20 characters of that name
   (including spaces) will be displayed.

   Next, the individual markers (up to a maximum of 1000) of the group are
   described. Each marker begins with a line consisting of the keyword
   'label' and ends with a line consisting of the keyword 'endlabel'.

   Do not start a new marker (by using a 'label' line) before you have
   closed the previous marker (by using an 'endlabel' line). You must end
   a previous marker specification before starting a new one. i.e. do not
   overlap marker specifications in the input file.

   For each marker, the line following the 'label' line describes the
   marker. Three types of markers can be drawn: ticks, blocks, and ranges.

   For a tick, the descriptive line begins with the keyword 'Tick',
   followed by the position of the tick in the DNA fragment, and a number
   from 0 to 15 specifying the color in which the tick will be drawn (a
   list of available colors is given below). If desired, one or more names
   can be written above the tick. In this case an optional letter H or V
   should be added to the line. H or V indicate whether the text will be
   horizontal or vertical, respectively. If no letter is specified, H is
   assumed by default. A list of one or more names can be given on the
   next lines with one name per line.

   For a block, the descriptive line begins with the keyword 'Block',
   followed by the start and end positions of the block in the DNA
   fragment, and the number of the block's color. If desired, one or more
   names can be written above the block. Names are given on the following
   lines. An optional letter H or V can be added to the end of the
   descriptive line to specify the orientation of the name(s).

   For a range, the descriptive line begins with the keyword 'Range',
   followed by the start and end positions of the range in the DNA
   fragment. Next on the line are the types of boundaries that are to be
   drawn. The user can choose among '>', '<', '[', ']' and '|' for both
   start and end boundaries. If none of these types is wanted for a given
   boundary, then a point '.' must be entered. Next is the color number.
   If desired, one or more names can be written above the range. Names are
   given on the following lines. An optional letter H or V can be added to
   the end of the descriptive line to specify the orientation of the
   name(s).

   For any type of markers, names will be written in the same color as the
   marker. Also, try to avoid long names.

   The colors defined in the PLPLOT graphics library are:

   0 "BLACK", 1 "RED", 2 "YELLOW", 3 "GREEN", 4 "AQUAMARINE", 5 "PINK", 6
   "WHEAT", 7 "GREY", 8 "BROWN", 9 "BLUE", 10 "BLUEVIOLET", 11 "CYAN", 12
   "TURQUOISE", 13 "MAGENTA", 14 "SALMON", and 15 "WHITE".

   This format can also be used for the program "cirdna".
