                                Program oddcomp
                                       
Function

   Finds protein sequence regions with a biased composition
   
Description

   oddcomp searches a series of protein files, reporting the identifier
   for those that exceed a certain amino acid composition threshold in a
   portion of the sequence.
   
   oddcomp was written to answer the question 'which proteins contain at
   least n X and m Y in p residues'.
   
   One could search for serine rich or polyglutamine rich, collagen
   helix, or similar proteins using this program.
   
   oddcomp takes as input an amino acid composition data file in the same
   format as the output from compseq. It can tolerate any word length
   within reason for the memory capacity of the machine in question. Only
   the first two fields in the composition data file are used: the word
   and the number of occurrences. Any word not mentioned is initialised
   to a threshold of zero.
   
   oddcomp measures the amino acid composition (this can be dimers etc as
   well as monomers) in a sliding window. If and when composition meets
   or exceeds all the specified thresholds, the sequence is reported and
   oddcomp moves to the next sequence. It does not report where in the
   sequence it found the matching region, merely the sequence ID.
   
   oddcomp was originally written to identify SR/RS containing proteins.
   eg. specifying a window of forty amino acids containing at least 3 SR
   and 4 RS words.
   
   To search for a specific set of words in a sequence, edit the input
   composition data file to delete any words from the input file in which
   you are not interested. The search is a boolean AND so there must be
   (from the short example above) at least 3 SR AND at least 4 RS for the
   sequence to be reported. If your total words specified exceeds
   window-wordlength+1 you will never get any hits.
   
   Only one word size can be used and is specified at the top of the file
   in compseq-style output.
   
Usage

   An example of the use of oddcomp to search for entries in swissprot
   with at least 1 SR AND at least 2 RS follows:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
  [-outfile]           outfile    This is the results file.
  [-compdata]          infile     This is a file in the format of the output
                                  produced by 'compseq' that is used to set
                                  the minimum frequencies of words in this
                                  analysis.
  [-window]            integer    This is the size of window in which to
                                  count.
                                  Thus if you want to count frequencies in a
                                  40 aa stretch you should enter 40 here.

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -[no]ignorebz       bool       The amino acid code B represents Asparagine
                                  or Aspartic acid and the code Z represents
                                  Glutamine or Glutamic acid.
                                  These are not commonly used codes and you
                                  may wish not to count words containing them,
                                  just noting them in the count of 'Other'
                                  words.

   General qualifiers:
  -help                bool       report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 2) This is the results file. Output file <sequence>.oddcomp
   [-compdata]
   (Parameter 3) This is a file in the format of the output produced by
   'compseq' that is used to set the minimum frequencies of words in this
   analysis. Input file Required
   [-window]
   (Parameter 4) This is the size of window in which to count. Thus if
   you want to count frequencies in a 40 aa stretch you should enter 40
   here. Integer 10 or more 30
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -[no]ignorebz The amino acid code B represents Asparagine or Aspartic
   acid and the code Z represents Glutamine or Glutamic acid. These are
   not commonly used codes and you may wish not to count words containing
   them, just noting them in the count of 'Other' words. Yes/No Yes
   
Input file format

   The data file ('test.comp') used in the example follows:
     _________________________________________________________________
   
# Example input file for oddcomp
Word size       2
Total count     0

#
# Word  Obs Count       Obs Frequency   Exp Frequency   Obs/Exp Frequency
#
RS      2               0               0               0
SR      1               0               0               0

Other   0               0               0               0
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   The columns "Obs Frequency", "Exp Frequency" and "Obs/Exp Frequency"
   are not required - they were simply included in this example to show
   the similarity between this input file format and the output of the
   program compseq. A compseq output file can be used as the input to
   oddcomp - the extra columns are ignored by oddcomp.
   
   A minimal composition input data file would look like this:
     _________________________________________________________________
   
Word size       2
Total count     0
RS      2
SR      1
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.
   
   The first non-comment line should start with 'Word size' and will
   specify the word size to use.
   
   A line starting with the word 'Total' is required.
   
   Anything after the line starting with the word 'Total' will be read as
   word count data.
   
   Word count data consists of a word to search for and the count of that
   word to search for within the sliding window. The columns are
   separated by one or more spaces or TAB characters. Anything after
   these two columns will be ignored.
   
Output file format

   A list of sequence name identifiers.
   
   The output from the above example follows:
     _________________________________________________________________
   
#
# Output from 'oddcomp'
#
# The Expected frequencies are taken from the file: test.comp
#
#       Word size: 2
        CB1B_FUGRU
        CO9_FUGRU
        FOS_FUGRU
        RS7_FUGRU

#       END     #
