                                Program fuzzpro
                                       
Function

   Protein pattern search
   
Description

   fuzzpro uses PROSITE style patterns to search protein sequences.
   
   Patterns are specifications of a (typically short) length of sequence
   to be found. They can specify a search for an exact sequence or they
   can allow various ambiguities, matches to variable lengths of sequence
   and repeated subsections of the sequence.
   
   fuzzpro intelligently selects the optimum searching algorithm to use,
   depending on the complexity of the search pattern specified.

Input file format

   Patterns for fuzzpro are based on the format of pattern used in the
   PROSITE database, with the difference that the terminating dot '.' and
   the hyphens, '-', between the characters are optional.
   
   The PROSITE pattern definition from the PROSITE documentation follows.
   
     * The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the amino acids are used.
     * The symbol `x' is used for a position where any amino acid is
       accepted.
     * Ambiguities are indicated by listing the acceptable amino acids
       for a given position, between square parentheses `[ ]'. For
       example: [ALT] stands for Ala or Leu or Thr.
     * Ambiguities are also indicated by listing between a pair of curly
       brackets `{ }' the amino acids that are not accepted at a given
       position. For example: {AM} stands for any amino acid except Ala
       and Met.
     * Each element in a pattern is separated from its neighbor by a `-'.
       (Optional in fuzzpro).
     * Repetition of an element of the pattern can be indicated by
       following that element with a numerical value or a numerical range
       between parenthesis. Examples: x(3) corresponds to x-x-x, x(2,4)
       corresponds to x-x or x-x-x or x-x-x-x.
     * When a pattern is restricted to either the N- or C-terminal of a
       sequence, that pattern either starts with a `<' symbol or
       respectively ends with a `>' symbol.
     * A period ends the pattern. (Optional in fuzzpro).
       
   For example, in SWISSPROT entry 100K_RAT you can look for the pattern:
[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C

   This means: Two Asps or Glus in any order followed by His, Ser, any
   residue other then Pro, then two of any residue followed by Pro
   followed by two to four of any residue followed by Cys.
   
   The search is case-independent, so 'AAA' matches 'aaa'.
   
Output file format

   Here is the output from the example search:
   

     ACT1_FUGRU    53 YVGDEAQSKRG
     ACT2_FUGRU    53 YVGDEAQSKRG
     ACT3_FUGRU    53 YVGDEAQSKRG
     ACTC_FUGRU    55 YVGDEAQSKRG
     ACTS_FUGRU    55 YVGDEAQSKRG
     ACTT_FUGRU    55 YVGDEAQSKRG

   It is composed of three columns of data.
   
     * The first column is the name of the sequence being searched.
     * The second is the start position of the match found.
     * The third is the actual sequence that was matched by the search
       pattern.
       
   If the option '-mmshow' is used, then an extra column of data is
   output indicating how many mismatches there are:
   
% fuzzpro -mmshow
Protein pattern search
Input sequence(s): sw:100k_rat
Search pattern: RARLX(3)R
Number of mismatches [0]: 1
Output file [100k_rat.fuzzpro]: stdout

       100K_RAT   613     1 EARLNCFRN

   If the option '-desc' is used then the description of the sequence is
   displayed before each line showing the match details. For example:
   
% fuzzpro 'sw:*_HUMAN' -desc
Protein pattern search
Search pattern: [FY]-[LIV]-G-[DE]-E-A-Q-x-[RKQ](2)-G
Number of mismatches [0]:
Output file [143b_human.fuzzpro]: stdout

ACTIN, AORTIC SMOOTH MUSCLE (ALPHA-ACTIN 2).
     ACTA_HUMAN    55 YVGDEAQSKRG
ACTIN, CYTOPLASMIC 1 (BETA-ACTIN).
     ACTB_HUMAN    53 YVGDEAQSKRG
ACTIN, ALPHA CARDIAC.
     ACTC_HUMAN    55 YVGDEAQSKRG
ACTIN, CYTOPLASMIC 2 (GAMMA-ACTIN).
     ACTG_HUMAN    53 YVGDEAQSKRG
ACTIN, GAMMA-ENTERIC SMOOTH MUSCLE (ALPHA-ACTIN 3).
     ACTH_HUMAN    54 YVGDEAQSKRG
ACTIN, ALPHA SKELETAL MUSCLE (ALPHA-ACTIN 1).
     ACTS_HUMAN    55 YVGDEAQSKRG

   If the option '-acc' is also used then the accession number of the
   sequence is displayed before each line showing the match details. For
   example:
   
% fuzzpro 'sw:*_HUMAN' -desc -acc
Protein pattern search
Search pattern: [FY]-[LIV]-G-[DE]-E-A-Q-x-[RKQ](2)-G
Number of mismatches [0]:
Output file [143b_human.fuzzpro]: stdout

P03996 ACTIN, AORTIC SMOOTH MUSCLE (ALPHA-ACTIN 2).
     ACTA_HUMAN    55 YVGDEAQSKRG
P02570 ACTIN, CYTOPLASMIC 1 (BETA-ACTIN).
     ACTB_HUMAN    53 YVGDEAQSKRG
P04270 ACTIN, ALPHA CARDIAC.
     ACTC_HUMAN    55 YVGDEAQSKRG
P02571 ACTIN, CYTOPLASMIC 2 (GAMMA-ACTIN).
     ACTG_HUMAN    53 YVGDEAQSKRG
P12718 ACTIN, GAMMA-ENTERIC SMOOTH MUSCLE (ALPHA-ACTIN 3).
     ACTH_HUMAN    54 YVGDEAQSKRG
P02568 ACTIN, ALPHA SKELETAL MUSCLE (ALPHA-ACTIN 1).
     ACTS_HUMAN    55 YVGDEAQSKRG

   If the option '-usa' is used then the Uniform Sequence Address is
   output at the start of each line of match details. For example:
   
% fuzzpro 'sw:*_HUMAN' -usa
Protein pattern search
Search pattern: [FY]-[LIV]-G-[DE]-E-A-Q-x-[RKQ](2)-G
Number of mismatches [0]:
Output file [143b_human.fuzzpro]: stdout
sw-id:ACTA_HUMAN             ACTA_HUMAN    55 YVGDEAQSKRG
sw-id:ACTB_HUMAN             ACTB_HUMAN    53 YVGDEAQSKRG
sw-id:ACTC_HUMAN             ACTC_HUMAN    55 YVGDEAQSKRG
sw-id:ACTG_HUMAN             ACTG_HUMAN    53 YVGDEAQSKRG
sw-id:ACTH_HUMAN             ACTH_HUMAN    54 YVGDEAQSKRG
sw-id:ACTS_HUMAN             ACTS_HUMAN    55 YVGDEAQSKRG

   This is useful because it turns the output into a 'list' file of
   sequence names that can then be read in by other EMBOSS programs when
   a '@' is put at the start of the file.
