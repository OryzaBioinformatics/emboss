Function

   Fitch-Margoliash and Least-Squares Distance Methods

Description

   Estimates phylogenies from distance matrix data under the "additive
   tree model" according to which the distances are expected to equal the
   sums of branch lengths between the species. Uses the Fitch-Margoliash
   criterion and some related least squares criteria, or the Minimum
   Evolution distance matrix method. Does not assume an evolutionary
   clock. This program will be useful with distances computed from
   molecular sequences, restriction sites or fragments distances, with
   DNA hybridization measurements, and with genetic distances computed
   from gene frequencies.

Algorithm

   The programs FITCH, KITSCH, and NEIGHBOR are for dealing with data
   which comes in the form of a matrix of pairwise distances between all
   pairs of taxa, such as distances based on molecular sequence data,
   gene frequency genetic distances, amounts of DNA hybridization, or
   immunological distances. In analyzing these data, distance matrix
   programs implicitly assume that:
     * Each distance is measured independently from the others: no item
       of data contributes to more than one distance.
     * The distance between each pair of taxa is drawn from a
       distribution with an expectation which is the sum of values (in
       effect amounts of evolution) along the tree from one tip to the
       other. The variance of the distribution is proportional to a power
       p of the expectation.

   These assumptions can be traced in the least squares methods of
   programs FITCH and KITSCH but it is not quite so easy to see them in
   operation in the Neighbor-Joining method of NEIGHBOR, where the
   independence assumptions is less obvious.

   THESE TWO ASSUMPTIONS ARE DUBIOUS IN MOST CASES: independence will not
   be expected to be true in most kinds of data, such as genetic
   distances from gene frequency data. For genetic distance data in which
   pure genetic drift without mutation can be assumed to be the mechanism
   of change CONTML may be more appropriate. However, FITCH, KITSCH, and
   NEIGHBOR will not give positively misleading results (they will not
   make a statistically inconsistent estimate) provided that additivity
   holds, which it will if the distance is computed from the original
   data by a method which corrects for reversals and parallelisms in
   evolution. If additivity is not expected to hold, problems are more
   severe. A short discussion of these matters will be found in a review
   article of mine (1984a). For detailed, if sometimes irrelevant,
   controversy see the papers by Farris (1981, 1985, 1986) and myself
   (1986, 1988b).

   For genetic distances from gene frequencies, FITCH, KITSCH, and
   NEIGHBOR may be appropriate if a neutral mutation model can be assumed
   and Nei's genetic distance is used, or if pure drift can be assumed
   and either Cavalli-Sforza's chord measure or Reynolds, Weir, and
   Cockerham's (1983) genetic distance is used. However, in the latter
   case (pure drift) CONTML should be better.

   Restriction site and restriction fragment data can be treated by
   distance matrix methods if a distance such as that of Nei and Li
   (1979) is used. Distances of this sort can be computed in PHYLIp by
   the program RESTDIST.

   For nucleic acid sequences, the distances computed in DNADIST allow
   correction for multiple hits (in different ways) and should allow one
   to analyse the data under the presumption of additivity. In all of
   these cases independence will not be expected to hold. DNA
   hybridization and immunological distances may be additive and
   independent if transformed properly and if (and only if) the standards
   against which each value is measured are independent. (This is rarely
   exactly true).

   FITCH and the Neighbor-Joining option of NEIGHBOR fit a tree which has
   the branch lengths unconstrained. KITSCH and the UPGMA option of
   NEIGHBOR, by contrast, assume that an "evolutionary clock" is valid,
   according to which the true branch lengths from the root of the tree
   to each tip are the same: the expected amount of evolution in any
   lineage is proportional to elapsed time.

Output file format

   ffitch output consists of an unrooted tree and the lengths of the
   interior segments. The sum of squares is printed out, and if P = 2.0
   Fitch and Margoliash's "average percent standard deviation" is also
   computed and printed out. This is the sum of squares, divided by N-2,
   and then square-rooted and then multiplied by 100 (n is the number of
   species on the tree):

     APSD = ( SSQ / (N-2) )1/2 x 100.

   where N is the total number of off-diagonal distance measurements that
   are in the (square) distance matrix. If the S (subreplication) option
   is in force it is instead the sum of the numbers of replicates in all
   the non-diagonal cells of the distance matrix. But if the L or R
   option is also in effect, so that the distance matrix read in is
   lower- or upper-triangular, then the sum of replicates is only over
   those cells actually read in. If S is not in force, the number of
   replicates in each cell is assumed to be 1, so that N is n(n-1), where
   n is the number of species. The APSD gives an indication of the
   average percentage error. The number of trees examined is also printed
   out.
