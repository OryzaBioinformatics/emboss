Function

   Codon usage table comparison
   
Description

   This program reads in two codon usage table files.
   
   It counts the number of the 64 possible codons which are unused (i.e.
   has a usage fraction of 0) in either one or the other or both of the
   codon usage tables.
   
   The usage fraction of a codon is its proportion (0 to 1) of the total
   of the codons in the sequences used to construct the usage table.
   
   For each codon that is used in both tables, it takes the difference
   between the usage fraction. The sum of the differences and the sum of
   the differences squared is reported in the output file, together with
   the number of unused codons.
   
  Statistical significance
  
   Question:
   
   How do you interpret the statistical significance of any difference
   between the tables?
   
   Answer:
   
   This is a very interesting question. I don't think that there is any
   way to say if it is statistically significant just from looking at it,
   as it is essentially a descriptive statistic about the difference
   between two 64-mer vectors. If you have a whole lot of sequences and
   codcmp results for all the possible pairwise comparisons, then the
   resulting distance matrix can be used to build a phylogenetic tree
   based on codon usage.
   
   However, if you generate a series of random sequences, measure their
   codon usage and then do codcmp between each of your test sequences and
   all the random sequences, you could then use a z-test to see if the
   result between the two test sequences was outside of the top or bottom
   5%.
   
   This would assume that the codcmp results were normally distributed,
   but you could test that too. The simplest way is just to plot them and
   look for a bell-curve. For more rigour, find the mean and standard
   deviation of your results from the random sequences, use the normal
   distribution equation to generate a theoretical distribution for that
   mean and standard deviation, and then perform a chi square between the
   random data and the theoretically generated normal distribution. If
   you generate two sets of random data, each based on your two test
   sequences, an F-test should be used to establish that they have equal
   variances. Then you can safely go ahead and perform the z-test.
   
   You could use shuffle to base your random sequences on the test
   sequences - so that would ensure the randomised background had the
   same nucleotide content.
   
   F-tests, z-tests and chi-tests can all be done in Excel, as well as
   being standard in most statistical analysis packages.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with codcmp
   
   This compares the codon usage tables for Escherichia coli and
   Haemophilus influenzae.
   

% codcmp 
Codon usage table comparison
Codon usage file [Ehum.cut]: Eeco.cut
Codon usage file [Ehum.cut]: Ehin.cut
Output file [outfile.codcmp]:

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-first]
   (Parameter 1) First codon usage file Codon usage file in EMBOSS data
   path Ehum.cut
   [-second]

Input file format

   It reads in the Codon Usage Tables - these are available as EMBOSS
   data files. See below for details.
   
Output file format

  Output files for usage example
  
  File: outfile.codcmp
  
# CODCMP codon usage table comparison
# Eeco.cut vs Ehin.cut

Sum Squared Difference = 2.337
Mean Squared Difference = 0.037
Root Mean Squared Difference = 0.191
Sum Difference         = 9.840
Mean Difference         = 0.154
Codons not appearing   = 0
   
Data files

   The codon usage tables are read by default from "Ehum.cut" in the
   data/CODONS directory of the EMBOSS distribution.
   
   If the name of a codon usage file is specified on the command line,
   then this file will first be searched for in the current directory and
   then in the 'data/CODONS' directory of the EMBOSS distribution.
   
   To see the available EMBOSS codon usage files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the codon usage tables (for example 'Emus.cut') into
   your current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Emus.cut
