Function

   Codon usage table comparison
   
Description

   This program reads in two codon usage table files.
   
   It counts the number of the 64 possible codons which are unused (i.e.
   has a usage fraction of 0) in either one or the other or both of the
   codon usage tables.
   
   The usage fraction of a codon is its proportion (0 to 1) of the total
   of the codons in the sequences used to construct the usage table.
   
   For each codon that is used in both tables, it takes the difference
   between the usage fraction. The sum of the differences and the sum of
   the differences squared is reported in the output file, together with
   the number of unused codons.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with codcmp
   
   This compares the codon usage tables for Escherichia coli and
   Haemophilus influenzae.
   

% codcmp 
Codon usage table comparison
Codon usage file [Ehum.cut]: Eeco.cut
Codon usage file [Ehum.cut]: Ehin.cut
Output file [outfile.codcmp]:

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-first]
   (Parameter 1) First codon usage file Codon usage file in EMBOSS data
   path Ehum.cut
   [-second]
   (Parameter 2) Second codon usage file Codon usage file in EMBOSS data
   path Ehum.cut
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 3) Output file name Output file <sequence>.codcmp
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

   It reads in the Codon Usage Tables - these are available as EMBOSS
   data files. See below for details.
   
Output file format

  Output files for usage example
  
  File: outfile.codcmp
  
# CODCMP codon usage table comparison
# Eeco.cut vs Ehin.cut

Sum Squared Difference = 2.337
Mean Squared Difference = 0.037
Root Mean Squared Difference = 0.191
Sum Difference         = 9.840
Mean Difference         = 0.154
Codons not appearing   = 0
   
Data files

   The codon usage tables are read by default from "Ehum.cut" in the
   data/CODONS directory of the EMBOSS distribution.
   
   If the name of a codon usage file is specified on the command line,
   then this file will first be searched for in the current directory and
   then in the 'data/CODONS' directory of the EMBOSS distribution.
   
   To see the available EMBOSS codon usage files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the codon usage tables (for example 'Emus.cut') into
   your current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Emus.cut
