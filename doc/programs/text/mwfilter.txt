Function

   Filter noisy molwts from mass spec output
   
Description

   mwfilter is designed to remove unwanted (noisy) data from mass
   spectrometry output in proteomics. Given a list of molecular weights
   this program removes those which are:
   
     * Contaminating trypsin or keratin
     * Modified oxy-methionine or oxy-threonine
     * Peaks associated with sodium ions.
       
   The last two operations can be done as most peaks are reported in both
   modified and unmodified forms. Removal of modified peaks aids in
   database searching for protein identification.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with mwfilter:

% mwfilter
Filter noisy molwts from mass spec output
Input file: molwts.dat
ppm tolerance [50.0]:
Output file [molwts.mwfilter]:

Input file format

   The input file is a simple list of the experimental molecular weights.
   There should be one weight per line.
   
   Comments in the data file start with a '#' character in the first
   column.
   Blank lines are ignored.
   
   An example of the input data follows:

Output file format

   The output is a list of the molecular weights with the unwanted
   (noisy) data removed.

Data files

   The program reads the data file Emwfilter.dat for the molecular
   weights of items to be deleted from the experimental data.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
   
% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
