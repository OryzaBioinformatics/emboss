                                 Program syco
                                       
Function

   Synonymous codon usage Gribskov statistic plot
   
Description

   syco is a frame-specific gene finder that tries to recognize protein
   coding sequences by virtue of the similarity of their codon usage to a
   codon frequency table.
   
   syco finds regions of each forward reading frame of a nucleic acid
   sequence that show strong codon preference. syco is useful for
   locating protein coding regions, determining their reading frames,
   estimating the level of expression of a gene, and locating nucleic
   acid sequencing errors.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with syco, requesting graphical output.

% syco -plot -cfile pae
Synonymous codon usage Gribskov statistic plot
Input sequence: embl:paamir
Graph type [x11]:

   click here for the result with the correct codon usage file.
   
   It is essential to use the correct codon usage file for the species.
   For example, click here for the result with the default codon usage
   file (no -cfile qualifier).
   
Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-sequence]          sequence   Sequence USA
*  -graph              xygraph    Graph type
*  -outfile            outfile    Output file name

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -cfile              codon      Codon usage file
   -window             integer    Averaging window
   -uncommon           bool       Show common codon usage
   -minimum            float      Minimum value for a common codon
   -plot               bool       Produce plot
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence USA Readable sequence Required
   -graph Graph type EMBOSS has a list of known devices, including
   postscript, ps, hpgl, hp7470, hp7580, meta, colourps, cps, xwindows,
   x11, tektronics, tekt, tek4107t, tek, none, null, text, data, xterm
   EMBOSS_GRAPHICS value, or x11
   -outfile Output file name Output file <sequence>.syco
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -cfile Codon usage file Codon usage file in EMBOSS data path Ehum.cut
   -window Averaging window Any integer value 30
   -uncommon Show common codon usage Yes/No No
   -minimum Minimum value for a common codon Number from 0.000 to 0.990
   .15
   -plot Produce plot Yes/No No
   
Input file format

   Nucleic acid sequence USA.
   
Output file format

   Graphical display.
   
Data files

   Codon usage table files are read in.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
   
% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
       
Notes

   None.
   
References

   None.
   
Warnings

   The default codon usage table file is the human Ehum.cut - caution:
   this may well not be the correct species.
   
Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.
   
Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.
   
Known bugs

   None.
