Function

   Protein proteolytic enzyme or reagent cleavage digest
   
Description

   digest finds the positions where a specified proteolytic enzyme or
   reagent might cut a peptide sequence.
   
   This programs allows you to input a protein sequence and to specify
   one proteolytic agent from a list. It will then output a file
   containing the positions where the agent cuts, together with the
   peptides produced.
   
   Trypsin will not normally cut after a K if it is followed by (e.g.)
   another K or a P. Specifying the qualifier -unfavoured shows those
   cuts. as well as the favoured ones.
   
   If you wish to emulate a partial digestion, then using the -overlap
   qualifier will display the results from a digest in which all cut
   sites are used and in which one site at a time is not cut. Thus the
   resulting peptide fragments from the cut sites numbered 1, 2, 3, 4
   etc. are shown, plus the fragments produced by cutting at the sites
   1..3, 2..4, etc.
   
   i.e. fragments containing one potential cut site are also shown.
   
   If you wish to emulate a very partial digestion (!) then using the
   -allpartials qualifier will do what -overlap did, but also show all
   possible fragments from using all possible combinations of cut sites.
   For example, fragments from the cut sites numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and
   from the fragments produced by cutting between sites 1..3, 1..4, 1..5,
   2..4, 2..5, 3..5, etc.
   
   i.e. fragments containing one or more potential cut site are also
   shown.

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:

   -menu               menu       Select number
  [-outfile]           report     Output report file name

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -unfavoured         boolean    Trypsin will not normally cut after a K if
                                  it is followed by (e.g.) another K or a P.
                                  Specifying this shows those cuts. as well as
                                  the favoured ones.
   -aadata             string     Molecular weight data for amino acids
   -overlap            boolean    Used for partial digestion. Shows all cuts
                                  from favoured cut sites plus 1..3, 2..4,
                                  3..5 etc but not (e.g.) 2..5. Overlaps are
                                  therefore fragments with exactly one
                                  potential cut site within it.
   -allpartials        boolean    As for overlap but fragments containing more
                                  than one potential cut site are included.

   General qualifiers:

                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose

   as the favoured ones. Yes/No No
   -aadata Molecular weight data for amino acids Any string is accepted
   Eamino.dat
   -overlap Used for partial digestion. Shows all cuts from favoured cut
   sites plus 1..3, 2..4, 3..5 etc but not (e.g.) 2..5. Overlaps are
   therefore fragments with exactly one potential cut site within it.
   Yes/No No
   -allpartials As for overlap but fragments containing more than one
   potential cut site are included. Yes/No No
   
Input file format

   Any protein sequence.
   
Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS report file.
   
   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -rformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: embl,
   genbank, gff, pir, swiss, trace, listfile, dbmotif, diffseq, excel,
   feattable, motif, regions, seqtable, simple, srs, table, tagseq
   
   See:
   http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Themes/ReportFormats.html for
   further information on report formats.
   
   By default digest writes a 'seqtable' report file.

   The header information contains the propgram name, date of run, name
   of the reagent used to digest the protein and the number of fragments
   reported. The header will report if complete or partial digestion was
   chosen.
   
   The rest of the file consists of columns holding the following data:
     * The start position of the fragment
     * The end position of the fragment
     * The molecular weight of the fragment
     * The residue before the cut site ('.' if start of sequence)
     * The residue after the second cut site ('.' if end of sequence)
     * The sequence of the fragment.
