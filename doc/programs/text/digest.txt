Function

   Protein proteolytic enzyme or reagent cleavage digest
   
Description

   digest finds the positions where a specified proteolytic enzyme or
   reagent might cut a peptide sequence.
   
   This programs allows you to input a protein sequence and to specify
   one proteolytic agent from a list. It will then output a file
   containing the positions where the agent cuts, together with the
   peptides produced.
   
   Trypsin will not normally cut after a K if it is followed by (e.g.)
   another K or a P. Specifying the qualifier -unfavoured shows those
   cuts. as well as the favoured ones.
   
   If you wish to emulate a partial digestion, then using the -overlap
   qualifier will display the results from a digest in which all cut
   sites are used and in which one site at a time is not cut. Thus the
   resulting peptide fragments from the cut sites numbered 1, 2, 3, 4
   etc. are shown, plus the fragments produced by cutting at the sites
   1..3, 2..4, etc.
   
   i.e. fragments containing one potential cut site are also shown.
   
   If you wish to emulate a very partial digestion (!) then using the
   -allpartials qualifier will do what -overlap did, but also show all
   possible fragments from using all possible combinations of cut sites.
   For example, fragments from the cut sites numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and
   from the fragments produced by cutting between sites 1..3, 1..4, 1..5,
   2..4, 2..5, 3..5, etc.
   
   i.e. fragments containing one or more potential cut site are also
   shown.

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -unfavoured         bool       Trypsin will not normally cut after a K if
                                  it is followed by (e.g.) another K or a P.
                                  Specifying this shows those cuts. as well as
                                  the favoured ones.
   -overlap            bool       Used for partial digestion. Shows all cuts
                                  from favoured cut sites plus 1..3, 2..4,
                                  3..5 etc but not (e.g.) 2..5. Overlaps are
                                  therefore fragments with exactly one
                                  potential cut site within it.
   -allpartials        bool       As for overlap but fragments containing more
                                  than one potential cut site are included.

   The first non-blank line is the title containing the name of the
   program and the name o fthe input sequence with the range considered
   and the calculated molecular weight of the protein.
   
   The next non-blank line gives the name of the reagent used to digest
   the protein and the number of fragments reported. The line will report
   is complete or partial digestion was chosen. If the protein is not
   digested at all by the reagent chosen the following is reported:
"Is not proteolytically digested using (reagent name)"

   If '-overlap' was specified, the next line will be:
"Only overlapping partials shown:"

   If '-allpartials' was specified, the next line will be:
"All partials shown:"

   The next non-blank line gives the headings of the columns of data.
   
   The rest of the file consists of columns holding the following data:
     * The start position of the fragment
     * The end position of the fragment
     * The residue before the cut site (in brackets)
     * The sequence of the fragment. If the fragment is longer than 38
       residues then the sequence reported is truncated to 38 residues
       and '...' is in the last column
     * The residue after the second cut site (in brackets)
     * If the fragment is longer than 38 then '...' is in the last
       column, else this is blank.
