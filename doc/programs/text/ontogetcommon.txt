Function

   Get common ancestor for terms

Description

   ontogetcommon reads two or more terms from an ontology and traces their
   closest common ancestor.

Algorithm

   ontogetcommon traces up through the hierarchy of terms for the first
   term it reads. Successive terms are similarly traced, saving any
   ancestral terms that are already in the saved list.

   The search fails if any term has no common ancestor with all previous
   terms.

   The match reported is the first match found when tracing back.

   There is no test for common ancestors in multiple paths.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with ontogetcommon

Input file format

   ontogetcommon reads terms from an ontology database.

  Input files for usage example

  Database entry: "edam:{0097,0640}"

[Term]
id: EDAM_topic:0640
name: Nucleic acid sequence analysis
namespace: topic
def: Processing and analysis of nucleotide sequences and sequence-based entities
 such as alignments, motifs and profiles.
subset: bioinformatics
subset: edam
subset: topics
xref: BioCatalogue:Nucleotide Sequence Analysis
created_in: "beta12orEarlier"
is_a: EDAM_topic:0077 ! Nucleic acid analysis
is_a: EDAM_topic:0080 ! Sequence analysis

[Term]
id: EDAM_topic:0097

subset: edam
subset: topics
created_in: "beta12orEarlier"
is_a: EDAM_topic:0077 ! Nucleic acid analysis
is_a: EDAM_topic:0081 ! Structure analysis


Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS ontology term file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -oformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: obo,
   brief, list, html, xml, json, excel.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/OntologyFormats.html for further
   information on ontology formats.
