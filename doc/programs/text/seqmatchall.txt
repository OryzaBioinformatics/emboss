Function

   Does an all-against-all comparison of a set of sequences
   
Description

   This takes a set of sequences and does an all-against-all pairwise
   comparison of words (fragments of the sequences of a specified fixed
   size) in the sequences, finding regions of identity between any two
   sequences.
   
   The larger the specified word size, the faster the comparison will
   proceed. Regions whose stretches of identity are shorter than the word
   size will be missed. You should therefore choose a word size that is
   small enough to find those regions of similarity you are interested in
   within a reasonable time-frame.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with seqmatchall
   
   Here is an example using an increased word size to avoid accidental
   matches:
   

% seqmatchall 
Does an all-against-all comparison of a set of sequences
Input sequence set: tembl:eclac*
Word size [4]: 15
Output file [eclac.seqmatchall]:

Input file format

   seqmatchall reads a set of sequence USAs.
   
   The sequences must be either all protein or all nucleic acid.
   
  Input files for usage example
  
   'tembl:eclac*' is a sequence entry in the example nucleic acid
   database 'tembl'
   
Output file format

  Output files for usage example
  
  File: eclac.seqmatchall
  
1832  5646 7477 ECLAC 1 1832 ECLACA
1113  49 1161 ECLAC 1 1113 ECLACI
1500  4305 5804 ECLAC 1 1500 ECLACY
3078  1287 4364 ECLAC 1 3078 ECLACZ
159  1 159 ECLACA 1342 1500 ECLACY
60  1 60 ECLACY 3019 3078 ECLACZ
   
   ECLAC (the complete E.coli lac operon) matches ECLACI ECLACZ ECLACY
   and ECLACA (the individual genes), and there is a short overlap
   between ECLACY and the flanking genes ECLACZ and ECLACA
   
   The output is a list of regions of identity in pairs of sequences,
   each consisting of one line with 7 columns of data separated by TABs
   or space characters.
   
   The columns of data consist of:
   
     * The length of the region of identity.
     * The start position in sequence 1.
     * The end position in sequence 1.
     * The name of sequence 1.
     * The start position in sequence 2.
     * The end position in sequence 2.
     * The name of sequence 2.
       
Data files

   None.
   
Notes

   The larger the word size, the faster the comparisons will proceed, but
   regions of identitly smaller than the word size will not be reported.
