Function

   Builds the PROSITE motif database for patmatmotifs to search
   
Description

   Takes the IDentity, ACcession number and motif PAttern line contents
   from prosite entries. Also converts the PAttern into a regular
   expression and writes these four pieces to an output file - defaulted
   to be called 'prosite.lines'.
