Function

   Builds the PROSITE motif database for patmatmotifs to search
   
Description

   Takes the IDentity, ACcession number and motif PAttern line contents
   from prosite entries. Also converts the PAttern into a regular
   expression and writes these four pieces to an output file - defaulted
   to be called 'prosite.lines'.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with prosextract.

% prosextract
Extracting ID, AC & PA lines from the Prosite motif Database.
Enter name of prosite directory: data/PROSITE
        
% more prosite.lines
ASN_GLYCOSYLATION PS00001
N-glycosylation
N-{P}-[ST]-{P}
^N[^P][ST][^P]

CAMP_PHOSPHO_SITE PS00004
cAMP-
[RK](2)-x-[ST]
^[RK]{2}[^BJOUXZ][ST]

PKC_PHOSPHO_SITE PS00005
Protein
[ST]-x-[RK]
^[ST][^BJOUXZ][RK]

CK2_PHOSPHO_SITE PS00006
Casein
[ST]-x(2)-[DE]
^[ST][^BJOUXZ]{2}[DE]

etc.......

   The output files named after the prosite accession numbers can now
   also be seen in the prosite directory. This files are automatically
   created after prosextract is run.
   
Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-infdat]            string     Enter name of prosite directory

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   General qualifiers:
  -help                boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-infdat]
   (Parameter 1) Enter name of prosite directory Any string is accepted
   An empty string is accepted
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

   These files must be the "prosite.dat" and "prosite.doc" file of a
   Prosite distribution, containing all current prosite data.
   
Output file format

   These files are held in the prosite subdirectory of the emboss data
   directory. The default names are "prosite.lines" and "PS*****"
   (accession number documentation files)
   
Data files

   See Input file format above.
   
Notes

   This program is most useful when used as a prerequisite for
   patmatmotifs.
