Function

   Protein pattern search after translation
   
Description

   fuzztran uses PROSITE style protein patterns to search nucleic acid
   sequences translated in the specified frame(s).
   
   Patterns are specifications of a (typically short) length of sequence
   to be found. They can specify a search for an exact sequence or they
   can allow various ambiguities, matches to variable lengths of sequence
   and repeated subsections of the sequence.
   
   fuzztran intelligently selects the optimum searching algorithm to use,
   depending on the complexity of the search pattern specified.

   Here is a sample session with fuzztran, using all options.

Input file format

   Patterns for fuzztran are based on the format of pattern used in the
   PROSITE database, with the difference that the terminating dot '.' and
   the hyphens, '-', between the characters are optional.
   
   The PROSITE pattern definition from the PROSITE documentation follows.
     * The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the amino acids are used.
     * The symbol `x' is used for a position where any amino acid is
       accepted.
     * Ambiguities are indicated by listing the acceptable amino acids
       for a given position, between square parentheses `[ ]'. For
       example: [ALT] stands for Ala or Leu or Thr.
     * Ambiguities are also indicated by listing between a pair of curly
       brackets `{ }' the amino acids that are not accepted at a given
       position. For example: {AM} stands for any amino acid except Ala
       and Met.
     * Each element in a pattern is separated from its neighbor by a `-'.
       (Optional in fuzztran).
     * Repetition of an element of the pattern can be indicated by
       following that element with a numerical value or a numerical range
       between parenthesis. Examples: x(3) corresponds to x-x-x, x(2,4)
       corresponds to x-x or x-x-x or x-x-x-x.
     * When a pattern is restricted to either the N- or C-terminal of a
       sequence, that pattern either starts with a `<' symbol or
       respectively ends with a `>' symbol.
     * A period ends the pattern. (Optional in fuzztran).
       
   For example, you can look for the pattern:

[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C

   This means: Two Asps or Glus in any order followed by His, Ser, any
   residue other then Pro, then two of any residue followed by Pro
   followed by two to four of any residue followed by Cys.
   
   The search is case-independent, so 'AAA' matches 'aaa'.
   
Output file format

   Here is the output from the example search:
   
          RNOPS  1       97 RA
          RNOPS  1      133 RA
          RNOPS  1      421 RA
          RNOPS  1      625 RA
          RNOPS  1      835 RA
          RNOPS  1      919 RA
          RNOPS  2      227 RA
          RNOPS  2      752 RA
          RNOPS  3       72 RA

   It is composed of four columns of data.
   
     * The first column is the name of the sequence being searched.
     * The second is the frame of translation that the pattern was found
       in.
     * The third is the start position of the match found.
     * The fourth is the actual sequence that was matched by the search
       pattern.
       
   If the option '-mmshow' is used, then an extra fourth column of data
   is output indicating how many mismatches there are:
   
% fuzztran -mmshow -frame 6
Protein pattern search after translation
Input sequence(s): embl:rnops
Search pattern: TWLWLT
Number of mismatches [0]: 2
Output file [rnops.fuzztran]: stdout

          RNOPS  1      316     0 TWLWLT
          RNOPS  1     1138     2 QRLWLT

   If the option '-desc' is used then the description of the sequence is
   displayed before each line showing the match details. For example:
   
% fuzztran embl:rnops -desc
Protein pattern search after translation
Search pattern: TWLWLT
Number of mismatches [0]:
Output file [rnops.fuzztran]: stdout
R.norvegicus mRNA for rhodopsin.

R.norvegicus mRNA for rhodopsin.
          RNOPS  1      316 TWLWLT

   If the option '-acc' is also used then the accession number of the
   sequence is displayed before each line showing the match details. For
   example:
   
% fuzztran embl:rnops -desc -acc
Protein pattern search after translation
Search pattern: TWLWLT
Number of mismatches [0]:
Output file [rnops.fuzztran]: stdout

Z46957 R.norvegicus mRNA for rhodopsin.
          RNOPS  1      316 TWLWLT

   If the option '-usa' is used then the Uniform Sequence Address is
   output at the start of each line of match details. For example:
   
% fuzztran embl:rnops -usa
Protein pattern search after translation
Search pattern: TWLWLT
Number of mismatches [0]:
Output file [rnops.fuzztran]: stdout

embl-id:RNOPS             RNOPS  1      316 TWLWLT

   This is useful because it turns the output into a 'list' file of
   sequence names that can then be read in by other EMBOSS programs when
   a '@' is put at the start of the file.
   
Data files

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
       
   The Genetic Code data files are based on the NCBI genetic code tables.
   Their names and descriptions are:
   
   EGC.0
          Standard (Differs from GC.1 in that it only has initiation site
          'AUG')
          
   EGC.1
          Standard
          
   EGC.2
          Vertebrate Mitochondrial
          
   EGC.3
          Yeast Mitochondrial
          
   EGC.4
          Mold, Protozoan, Coelenterate Mitochondrial and
          Mycoplasma/Spiroplasma
          
   EGC.5
          Invertebrate Mitochondrial
          
   EGC.6
          Ciliate Macronuclear and Dasycladacean
          
   EGC.9
          Echinoderm Mitochondrial
          
   EGC.10
          Euplotid Nuclear
          
   EGC.11
          Bacterial
          
   EGC.12
          Alternative Yeast Nuclear
          
   EGC.13
          Ascidian Mitochondrial
          
   EGC.14
          Flatworm Mitochondrial
          
   EGC.15
          Blepharisma Macronuclear
          
   The format of these files is very simple.
   
   It consists of several lines of optional comments, each starting with
   a '#' character.
   
   These are followed the line: 'Genetic Code [n]', where 'n' is the
   number of the genetic code file.
   
   This is followed by the description of the code and then by four lines
   giving the IUPAC one-letter code of the translated amino acid, the
   start codons (indicdated by an 'M') and the three bases of the codon,
   lined up one on top of the other.

# Differs from Genetic Code [1] only in that the initiation sites have been
# changed to only 'AUG'
