Function

   Looks for tandem repeats in a nucleotide sequence
   
Description

   etandem looks for tandem repeats in a sequence. It is normally used
   after equicktandem has been run to identify potential repeat sizes. It
   calculates a consensus for the repeat region and gives a score for how
   many matches there are to the consensus - the number of mismatches.
   
   Input sequences are converted into ACGT or N (so ambiguity codes are
   ignored).
   The score is +1 for a match, -1 for a mismatch.
   The first copy of a repeat is ignored.
   The highest score is kept for each start position and repeat size.
   
   The lowest score to be reported is set by the threshold score. The
   threshold score can be set on the command-line using the -threshold
   qualifier, the default is 20. For perfect repeats, the score is the
   length of the repeat (except for the first copy). Reduce the threshold
   score a little if you wish to to allow mismatches. Each mismatch
   scores -1 instead of +1 so it scores 2 less than a perfect match of
   the same number of bases.
   
   Running with a wide range of repeat sizes is inefficient. That is why
   equicktandem was written - to give a rapid estimate of the major
   repeat sizes.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with etandem. The input sequence is the human
   herpesvirus tandem repeat.
   
% etandem
Input sequence: embl:hhtetra
Output file [hhtetra.tan]:
Minimum repeat size [10]: 6
Maximum repeat size [6]:

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -threshold          integer    Threshold score
   -mismatch           bool       Allow N as a mismatch

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence USA Readable sequence Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 2) Output file name Output file <sequence>.etandem
   -minrepeat Minimum repeat size Integer, 2 or higher 10

Input file format

   The input for etandem is a nucleotide sequence.
   
Output file format

   The output from etandem is an uncommented list of identified repeats.
   In a future version this will change to be annotated sequence
   features.
   
   The columns of the report show:
   
    1. Score
    2. Start base position
    3. End base position
    4. Repeat size
    5. Repeat count
    6. Percent identity
    7. Consensus sequence
       
   An example of the output is:
