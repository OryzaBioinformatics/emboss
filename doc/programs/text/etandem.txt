                                Program etandem
                                       
Function

   Looks for tandem repeats in a nucleotide sequence
   
Description

   etandem looks for tandem repeats in a sequence. It is normally used
   after equicktandem has been run to identify potential repeat sizes.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with etandem. The input sequence is the human
   herpesvirus tandem repeat.
% etandem
Input sequence: embl:hhtetra
Output file [hhtetra.tan]:
Minimum repeat size [10]: 6
Maximum repeat size [6]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          sequence   Sequence USA
  [-outfile]           outfile    Output file name
   -minrepeat          integer    Minimum repeat size
   -maxrepeat          integer    Maximum repeat size

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:
   -threshold          integer    Threshold score
   -mismatch           bool       Allow N as a mismatch
   -uniform            bool       Allow uniform consensus
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence USA Readable sequence Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 2) Output file name Output file <sequence>.etandem
   -minrepeat Minimum repeat size Integer, 2 or higher 10
   -maxrepeat Maximum repeat size Integer, same as -minrepeat or higher
   Same as -minrepeat
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -threshold Threshold score Any integer value 20
   -mismatch Allow N as a mismatch Yes/No No
   -uniform Allow uniform consensus Yes/No No
   
Input file format

   The input for etandem is a nucleotide sequence.
   
Output file format

   The output from etandem is an uncommented list of identified repeats.
   In a future version this will change to be annotated sequence
   features.
   
   The columns of the report show:
    1. Score
    2. Start base position
    3. End base position
    4. Repeat size
    5. Repeat count
    6. Percent identity
    7. Consensus sequence

Authors

   This program was originally written by Richard Durbin and Jean
   Thierry-Mieg as part of the ACEDB genome database package.
   
   This application was modified for inclusion in EMBOSS by Peter Rice

Priority

   Completed 25 May 1999
   
Target

   etandem is aimed at automated repeat identification in genomic
   sequnece but can also be used by general users.
