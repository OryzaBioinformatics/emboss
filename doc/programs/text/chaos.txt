                                 Program chaos
                                       
Function

   Create a chaos game representation plot for a sequence
   
Description

   A box is drawn and an AGCT is drawn at each corner.
   
   Starting from the middle, move half way to the corner of the box
   representing the first base in the sequence and draw a dot.
   
   Then for each subsequent base move half way to the corresponding box
   corner and draw a dot.
   
   Finally display the number and percentage values of AGCT bases.
