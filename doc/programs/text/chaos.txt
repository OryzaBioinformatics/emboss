Function

   Create a chaos game representation plot for a sequence
   
Description

   A box is drawn and an AGCT is drawn at each corner.
   
   Starting from the middle, move half way to the corner of the box
   representing the first base in the sequence and draw a dot.
   
   Then for each subsequent base move half way to the corresponding box
   corner and draw a dot.
   
   Finally display the number and percentage values of AGCT bases.
   
   The result is an image of a square sprinkled with dots. Areas which
   are devoid of dots (or heavily covered with dots) indicate short
   sequence motifs that are unusually infrequent (or frequent). The
   sequence of such motifs can be deduced by looking to see which quarter
   of teh square the region is in - the letter that this quarter belongs
   to is the first base of the motif. The quarter is then quartered again
   and the appropriate base letters are assigned to the corners of the
   quarter - the eigth part that the region is in gives the second base
   of the motif.
   
   The process continues until you have identified the 1/16th or 1/32nd,
   etc. of the original square containing the unusual region and you now
   have the sequence of the motif.
