Function

   TOPO creates an image of a transmembrane protein.

Description

   TOPO creates an image of a transmembrane region but the user must give
   the transmembrane regions for the sequence as it does not calculate
   these.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with topo.

% topo sw:aqp1_human -signa -prol=UM -cys=cg -gly=sr -acid=dr

Notes

   As you can see the lists above the are alot of options to choose for
   the displays of acidic, basic amino acids etc. This can be explained
   simply as :-

   One letter codes are black filled shaped EXCEPT for "N" which means
   NONE (no shape).

   For two letter codes the first letter is the shape and the second the
   colour except for "F" which means NO FILL.

   For the signatures you need to input sets of start position, end
   position and code. For the example given these are 74 82 sy 189 189 hm
   239 239 sa 157 157 sa 262 262 sa
So residues 74 to 82 will have Yellow Squares (sy).
   residue 189 (i.e. 189 to 189) will have a Magenta Hexagon. (hm)
