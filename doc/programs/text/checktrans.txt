Function

   Reports STOP codons and ORF statistics of a protein

Description

   checktrans reads a protein sequence containing stop characters and
   writes a statistical report of any open reading frames (ORFs) that are
   greater than a minimum size. An open reading frame is defined as a
   continuous region of protein sequence with no stop characters. The
   default minimum ORF size is 100 residues. In addition to the report
   output, any ORF sequences are written to file and features of those
   sequences written to a separate file.

Command line arguments

Reports STOP codons and ORF statistics of a protein
Version: EMBOSS:6.2.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Protein sequence(s) filename and optional
                                  format, or reference (input USA)
   -orfml              integer    [100] Minimum ORF Length to report (Integer
                                  1 or more)
  [-outfile]           outfile    [*.checktrans] Output file name
  [-outseq]            seqoutall  [.] Sequence file to hold
                                  output ORF sequences
  [-outfeat]           featout    [unknown.gff] File for output features

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -[no]addlast        boolean    [Y] An asterisk in the protein sequence
                                  indicates the position of a STOP codon.
                                  Checktrans assumes that all ORFs end in a
                                  STOP codon. Forcing the sequence to end with
                                  an asterisk, if there is not one there
                                  already, makes checktrans treat the end as a
                                  potential ORF. If an asterisk is added, it
                                  is not included in the reported count of
                                  STOPs.

Output file format

   This program writes three files: the ORF report file
   (x13776_1.checktrans), the output sequence file (x13776_1.fasta) and
   the feature file (x13776_1.out3) which is in GFF format by default.

   The ORF report file gives the numeric count of the ORF, the position of
   the terminating STOP codon, the length of the ORF, its start and end
   positions and the name of the sequence it has been written out as.

   The name of the output sequences is constructed from the name of the
   input sequence followed by an underscore and then the numeric count of
   the ORF (e.g. 'X13776_1_7').

Notes

   A reading frame is a relative position in DNA or RNA from which
   contiguous, non-overlapping codons are read during transcription. There
   are 3 possible reading frames in mRNA strand and six in a double
   stranded DNA where transcription is possible from either strand. An
   open reading frame (ORF) is a reading frame that begins with a start
   codon and includes the subsequent transcribed region, stopping
   immediately before the first stop codon.

   Where you have a nucleotide sequence for analysis, it should first be
   translated by using transeq. The transeq output file will then serve as
   the input to checktrans. Note that if you have only translated a
   nucleic sequence in one frame, checktrans will miss possible ORFs in
   the other frames. You must provide checktrans with translations in all
   three (six?) frames in order for it to be effective at finding all
   possible ORFs.
