Function

   Reports STOP codons and ORF statistics of a protein
   
Description

   Reads in a protein sequence containing stops, and writes a report of
   any open reading frames (continuous protein sequence with no stops)
   that are greater than a minimum size. The default minimum ORF size is
   100 residues. It writes out any ORF sequences.
   
   The input sequence might typically have been produced by transeq.
   
   Note that if you have only translated a nucleic sequence in one frame,
   checktrans will miss possible ORFs in other frames. You have to give
   checktrans translations in all three (six?) frames in order for it to
   be effective at finding all possible ORFs.
   
Usage

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
   -orfml              integer    Minimum ORF Length to report
  [-report]            outfile    Output file name
   -outseq             seqoutall  Sequence file to hold output ORF sequences

   Optional qualifiers:
   -[no]addlast        boolean    An asterisk in the protein sequence
                                  indicates the position of a STOP codon.
                                  Checktrans assumes that all ORFs end in a
                                  STOP codon. Forcing the sequence to end with
                                  an asterisk, if there is not one there
                                  already, makes checktrans treat the end as a
                                  potential ORF. If an asterisk is added, it
                                  is not included in the reported count of
                                  STOPs.

   Advanced qualifiers:
   -featout            featout    File for output features

   General qualifiers:
  -help                boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   -orfml Minimum ORF Length to report Integer 1 or more 100
   [-report]
   (Parameter 2) Output file name Output file <sequence>.checktrans
   -outseq Sequence file to hold output ORF sequences Writeable
   sequence(s) <sequence>.format
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -[no]addlast An asterisk in the protein sequence indicates the
   position of a STOP codon. Checktrans assumes that all ORFs end in a
   STOP codon. Forcing the sequence to end with an asterisk, if there is
   not one there already, makes checktrans treat the end as a potential
   ORF. If an asterisk is added, it is not included in the reported count
   of STOPs. Boolean value Yes/No Yes
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -featout File for output features Writeable feature table unknown.gff
   
Input file format

   This program reads the USA of a protein sequence with STOP codons in
   it.

Output file format

   This program writes three files: the ORF report file
   (paamir_1.checktrans), the output sequence file (paamir_1.fasta) and
   the feature file (paamir_1.out3) which is in GFF format by default.
   
  Output files for usage example
  
  File: paamir_1.checktrans

   The ORF report file gives the numeric count of the ORF, the position
   of the terminating STOP codon, the length of the ORF, its start and
   end positions and the name of the sequence it has been written out as.
   
   The name of the output sequences is constructed from the name of the
   input sequence followed by an underscore and then the numeric count of
   the ORF (e.g. 'PAAMIR_1_7').
