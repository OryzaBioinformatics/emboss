                               Program dbiblast
                                       
Function

   Index a BLAST database
   
Description

   dbiblast indexes a blast database created by the NCBI indexing
   programs formatdb, pressdb or setdb, and builds EMBL CD-ROM format
   index files. This format is used by the software on the EMBL database
   CD-ROM distribution and by the Staden package in addition to EMBOSS,
   and appears to be the most generally used and publicly available index
   file format.
   
   The index files of the blast database format are not useful by
   themselves as they do not hold the entrynames or accession numbers,
   but they are used as pointers to the reference and sequence
   information in the database.
   
   Because there are two sequence types (nucleic acid and protein) and
   two index formats (blast1 from pressdb or setdb, and blast2 from
   formatdb) with different index file names, dbiblast will ask about the
   database type. If the answer is "unknown" dbiblast will test each
   possible set of file names until one is found.

   Here is a sample session with dbiblast, using a blast 2 protein
   database.

Input file format

   An NCBI BLAST1 or BLAST2 database.
   
Output file format

   dbiblast creates four index files. All are binary but with a simple
   format.
     * division.lkp is the master index file, and has a 300 byte header
       containing the database name and date plus information on the
       record size. This header is followed by one record for each
       database file, giving the full file name for the data file, and
       optionally a second sequence file.
     * entryname.idx is the entry name index. It has the same 300 byte
       header, mainly used to store the record size which will depend on
       the size of the longest entryname in the database. Each entry is
       stored in sorted alphanumeric order so that a binary search can be
       used to efficiently find any record. The record also holds the
       file number from division.lkp and the offsets in the data and
       sequence files for that entry.
     * acnum.trg holds the accession number information. The file has the
       usual 300 byte header, and a sorted list of record by accession
       number. Each accession number record contains the first record
       number in acnum.hit and the total number of records in acnum.hit
       so that secondary (duplicated) accession numbers can be searched.
     * acnum.hit is a very simple file. After the usual 300 byte header,
       each record simply holds the record number in entryname.idx. An
       accession number search will use acnum.trg to find a start
       position and number of records to read in this file, and will then
       simply read the entryname.idx records for each entry in turn.
