Function

   Selects primers for PCR and DNA amplification
   
Description

   prima analyzes a template DNA sequence and chooses primer pairs for
   the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and primers for DNA sequencing.
   For PCR primer pair selection, you can choose a target range of the
   template sequence to be amplified. For DNA sequencing primers, you can
   specify positions on the template that must be included in the
   sequencing. You can allow prima to choose primers from the whole
   template or limit the choices to a particular set of primers listed in
   a file.
   
   In selecting appropriate primers, prima considers a variety of
   constraints on the primer and amplified product sequences. You either
   can use the program's default constraint values or modify those values
   to customize the analysis. You can specify upper and lower limits for
   primer and product melting temperatures and for primer and product GC
   contents. For primers, you can specify a range of acceptable primer
   sizes, any required bases at the 3' end of the primer (3' clamp), and
   a maximum difference in primer melting temperatures for PCR primer
   pairs. For PCR products, you can specify a range of acceptable product
   sizes.
   
   For efficient priming, you should avoid primers with extensive
   self-complementarity in order to minimize primer secondary structure
   and primer dimer formation. Additionally, in PCR experiments, primer
   pairs with extensive complementarity between the two primers should be
   avoided in order to minimize primer dimer formation. prima uses the
   annealing test described in the ALGORITHM topic to check individual
   primers for self-complementarity and to check the two primers in a PCR
   primer pair for complementarity to each other. Using this same
   annealing test, prima optionally can screen against non-specific
   primer binding on the template sequence and on any repeated sequences
   you specify.
   
   The terms forward primer and reverse primer are used in the remainder
   of this document and in the program output. Forward primers are
   complementary to sequences on the reverse template strand and create
   copies of the forward strand by primer extension. Conversely, reverse
   primers are complementary to sequences on the forward template strand
   and create copies of the reverse strand by primer extension.
   
   The name prima is a truly European one. In searching for yet another
   primer program name, we discovered that not only can "prima" be
   pronounced in English as "Primer", but it has additional meanings in
   other languages. In Italian it means "first", in German it means
   "super", and in Spanish it means "cousin".
   
  Thermodynamic Calculations
  
   prima determines primer melting temperatures by a calculation using
   the nearest-neighbor model of Borer, et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 86; 843-853
   (1974)) as modified slightly by Rychlik, et al. (Nucleic Acids Res.
   18; 6409-6412 (1990)) and the thermodynamic parameters for DNA
   nearest-neighbor interactions determined by Breslauer, et al. (Proc.
   Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 83; 3746-3750 (1986)):
   
   T(m)primer) = delta H / (delta S + R x ln(c/4) - 273.15 + 16.6 x
   log[K(+)]
   
   where delta H is the enthalpy of helix formation, delta S is the
   entropy of helix formation (including helix initiation), R is the
   molar gas constant (1.987 cal/degree Celsius/mol), and c is the primer
   concentration.
   
   prima determines PCR product melting temperatures using the formula of
   Baldino, et al. (in Methods Enzymol. 168; 761-777 (1989)) as modified
   slightly by Rychlik, et al. (Nucleic Acids Res. 18; 6409-6412 (1990)).
   
   T(m)product) = 0.41 x (% G+C) + 16.6 x log[K(+)] - 675 / len + 81.5
   
   where len is the length of the product.
   
   If you are selecting PCR primer pairs, the output includes a proposed
   annealing temperature for each listed primer pair. The annealing
   temperature is calculated using the formula of Rychlik, et al.
   (Nucleic Acids Res. 18; 6409-6412 (1990)).
   
   T(a) = 0.3 x T(m)primer) + 0.7 x T(m)product) - 14.9
   
  Annealing Tests
  
   prima uses an annealing test described by Hillier and Green (PCR
   Methods and Applications. 1; 124-128 (1991)), with slight
   modification, to check individual primers for self-complementarity and
   to check the two primers in a PCR primer pair for complementarity to
   each other. For tests of self-complementarity, a primer sequence in
   the 5' to 3' orientation is compared with the same sequence in the 3'
   to 5' orientation. For tests of complementarity between two different
   primers, one of the primer sequences in the 5' to 3' orientation is
   compared to the other sequence in the 3' to 5' orientation. The
   sequences are compared in every register of comparison, using a
   scoring matrix containing values of complementarity for every pair of
   nucleotide symbols. For each register of comparison, the score of each
   base pair comparison is determined. The scores of contiguous base
   pairs with positive comparison values are summed. The maximum score of
   all such contiguous segments, taken over all registers of comparison
   between the sequences, determines the total primer-primer annealing
   score. Complementarity at the 3' ends of the primer sequences has a
   particularly large influence on primer-dimer formation. Therefore, the
   maximum score of all contiguous segments that include the 3' position
   of either primer sequence, taken over all registers of comparison, is
   separately determined as the 3' primer-primer annealing score.
   
   The same annealing test is used to determine complementarity between
   the primer and any non-specific binding sites on the template
   sequences. In this case, the primer in the 5' to 3' orientation is
   compared over all registers of comparison with the template sequence
   in the 3' to 5' orientation to determine a total primer-template
   annealing score. Since complementarity at the 3' end of the primer
   sequence has a particularly large effect on non-specific primer
   binding, the 3' primer-template annealing score is also determined. If
   you screen against non-specific primer binding on any specified
   repeated sequences, then total primer-repeat and 3' primer-repeat
   annealing scores, taken over all registers of comparison in all
   repeated sequences, are also determined.
   
   Total and 3' annealing scores are saved in tests of primer
   self-complementarity (to check for secondary structure and primer
   dimer formation) and in tests of complementarity between the two
   primers in PCR primer pairs (to check for primer dimer formation).
   Total and 3' annealing scores are also saved when you screen against
   non-specific primer binding on the template sequence and when you
   screen against non-specific primer binding on any specified repeated
   sequences. Primers are rejected that exceed the maximum score you
   specify for any of these tests. For those primers that are accepted,
   the program uses the sum of all annealing scores to determine the
   order of primers or PCR primer pairs in the output list. You can
   specify weights for each of these scores to adjust their relative
   contributions in determining the output order. By default, 3'
   annealing scores have twice the weight of total annealing scores in
   determining the output order.

   The output file begins with a summary listing all of the constraints
   used by the program to select appropriate primers or PCR primer pairs.
   Most of these constraints can be modified by adjusting prompted and
   optional program parameters.
   
   Following these summaries is an ordered listing of the most
   appropriate primers or PCR primer pairs selected by prima. The list is
   ordered by total annealing score so that those primers or PCR primer
   pairs with the least amount of complementarity to sequences other than
   the appropriate primer binding sites are listed first. Each output
   primer or PCR primer pair is designated by a number that corresponds
   to a line number in the plot of primer sites. While the text output
   file lists the location of the primer binding site along with each
   primer sequence, the plot provides a convenient way to review the
   primer binding sites of many of the selected primers at once.

Warnings

   The template sequence may contain ambiguous bases, but prima will not
   select primers complementary to any ambiguous sites on the template
   sequence.
   
   When several acceptable PCR primer pairs have the same 3' ends for
   both primers, prima outputs only the PCR primer pair with the shortest
   primer sequences. By not allowing duplicate primer endpoints, prima
   increases the diversity among the PCR primer pairs in the output list.
   
   prima only determines melting temperatures for DNA primers. We do not
   know of any appropriate nearest-neighbor thermodynamic parameters for
   RNA-DNA hybrids, so we haven't attempted to calculate melting
   temperatures for RNA primers. While thermodynamic parameters for RNA
   duplexes involving mismatches have been described, we do not know of
   any similar results for DNA duplexes. Therefore, we have not attempted
   to calculate melting temperatures or other thermodynamic properties
   for DNA duplexes involving mismatches.
   
   prima does not currently consider formamide concentration in
   determining primer melting temperatures.
