Function

   Jemboss Authentication Control
   
Description

   jembossctl should not be run by typical users. It is a slave program
   for the Jemboss server. If this means nothing to you, then you do not
   need to know anything more, just ignore this program.
   
   If you are setting up a Jemboss server (This is not the Jemboss
   interface that anyone can download, it is the software that listens to
   the Jemboss interfaces and runs the EMBOSS programs for you), then
   this program should be 'chmod 4755' to get root. Details are to be
   found on the Jemboss web pages.
   
Usage

   It is not used by normal users. It is only ever run by other programs.
