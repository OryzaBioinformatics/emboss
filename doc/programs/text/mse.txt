Function

   Conversion of William A. Gilbert's ( Whitehead Insitutute ) MSE.
   
Description

   A Multiple Sequence Screen Editor for Biological Sequences.
   
Usage

   This is an interactive program and it is similar to many other
   multiple sequence editors, in that you run it, using a file of
   existing sequences, as:
   
   % mse file.seq
   
   ...you will then see a screen looking like this:

Press "?" for help
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   Pressing the cursor keys will move the cursor around, left and right,
   up and down. Moving the cursor in the sequences will also move the '#'
   character in the "bird's eye view" in the lower screen - this is an
   overview of where you currently are in the full-length set of
   sequences.
   
   If you press a key that is a valid nucleotide or residue code, then
   the appropriate sequence in the "bird's eye view" will be marked with
   a 'M' indicating that it has been modified.
   
   Pressing '?' at any time will display the help:

     _________________________________________________________________
   
   See below for the full display of these commands.
   
   As you can see in the help-screen above, you type in Control-Z to
   switch from moving around the sequences and editing the sequences to
   the mode in which you can type in text commands.
   
   When you have typed Control-Z, the prompt Command: appears at the
   bottom of the screen waiting for you to either type in a text command,
   or to simply press the RETURN key to return to editing the sequences.
   
   To get help when in command-mode, type help and press RETURN.
   
   To exit from the editor and write out your changed sequences to file,
   give the text command exit.

                           anchored group then that group will be melded.  You
                           will be prompted to continue if undetermined postiti
ons
                           are found in the melded sequence.

[s,f] WRIte [seqname]     - write [a part of] the sequence to a file. You

      EXIt  [FOSSname]    - write any modified sequences, a new FOSS file,
                             and then quit.
