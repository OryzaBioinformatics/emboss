Function

   Searches a DNA database for matches with a set of STS primers
   
Description

   stssearch searches a DNA sequence database with a set of STS primers
   and reports expected matches.
   
   stssearchs reads in one or more sequences to be searched. For each
   pair of primers, it looks for matches between a the primers and the
   query sequence in either orientation.
   
   Any matches found will be reported. Only one primer need match for it
   to be reported..
   
Usage

Input file format

  Input files for usage example
  
   'tembl:eclac*' is a sequence entry in the example nucleic acid
   database 'tembl'
   
  File: ../../data/lac.primers
  
PrimA ACCAGACACCCATCAACAG    TATTTATGCCAGCCAGCCAG

   The primers file consists of three columns separated by tabs or
   spaces.
   
   The first column is the name of the primer pair.
   The second column is the sequence of the first primer.
   The third column is the sequence of the second primer.

   The output file consists of one line per match. This consists of:
   
     * The name of the sequence that the match is found in, followed by a
       ':'.
     * If the match is in the reverse sense, it has a '(rev)'.
     * The name of the primer pair.
     * 'PrimerA' or 'PrimerB'.
     * 'matched at' the start of the match position.
