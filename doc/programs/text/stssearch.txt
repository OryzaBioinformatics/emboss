                               Program stssearch
                                       
Function

   Searches a DNA database for matches with a set of STS primers
   
Description

   Searches a DNA sequence database with a set of STS primers and reports
   expected matches and possible mismatches. A replacement for stssearch
   in the EGCG package.
   
   This reads in one or more sequences to be searched. For each pair of
   primers, this looks for exact matches between a the primers and the
   query sequence in either orientation.
   
   Any matches found will be reported. Only one primer need match.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with stssearch.

% stssearch
Input sequence(s): embl:eclac*
Primer file: lac.primers

Input file format

   Here is the primer input file for the example run:
     _________________________________________________________________
   
PrimA ACCAGACACCCATCAACAG    TATTTATGCCAGCCAGCCAG
PrimB CGAAAGAATAAGAGCAGGCAAG GTAAGAGAAATAGACAGGCGG

PrimE AATACGCAAACCGCCTCTCC   CACAACCCGCTCACAATTCCA
     _________________________________________________________________
   
   It consists of three columns separated by tabs or spaces.
   
   The first column is the name of the primer pair.
   The second column is the sequence of the first primer.
   The third column is the sequence of the second primer.
   
Output file format

   Here is the output from the example run:
     _________________________________________________________________
   
ECLAC: PrimA PrimerA matched at 532
ECLAC: (rev) PrimA PrimerB matched at 689

ECLAC: PrimC PrimerA matched at 2954

     _________________________________________________________________
   
   This consists of one line per match. This consists of:
   
     * The name of the sequence that the match is found in, followed by a
       ':'.
     * If the match is in the reverse sense, it has a '(rev)'.
     * The name of the primer pair.
     * 'PrimerA' or 'PrimerB'.
     * 'matched at' the start of the match position.
