Function

   Search a PROSITE motif database with a protein sequence
   
Description

   This takes a protein sequence and compares it to the PROSITE database
   of motifs.
   
   For a description of PROSITE, we can do no better than to quote the
   PROSITE user's documentation: 
   
   PROSITE is a method of determining what is the function of
   uncharacterized proteins translated from genomic or cDNA sequences. It
   consists of a database of biologically significant sites and patterns
   formulated in such a way that with appropriate computational tools it
   can rapidly and reliably identify to which known family of protein (if
   any) the new sequence belongs.
   
   In some cases the sequence of an unknown protein is too distantly
   related to any protein of known structure to detect its resemblance by
   overall sequence alignment, but it can be identified by the occurrence
   in its sequence of a particular cluster of residue types which is
   variously known as a pattern, motif, signature, or fingerprint. These
   motifs arise because of particular requirements on the structure of
   specific region(s) of a protein which may be important, for example,
   for their binding properties or for their enzymatic activity. These
   requirements impose very tight constraints on the evolution of those
   limited (in size) but important portion(s) of a protein sequence. To
   paraphrase Orwell, in Animal Farm, we can say that "some regions of a
   protein sequence are more equal than others" !
   
   The use of protein sequence patterns (or motifs) to determine the
   function(s) of proteins is becoming very rapidly one of the essential
   tools of sequence analysis. This reality has been recognized by many
   authors, as it can be illustrated from the following citations from
   two of the most well known experts of protein sequence analysis, R.F.
   Doolittle and A.M. Lesk:
      "There are  many short  sequences  that  are  often  (but  not  always)
      diagnostics of certain binding properties or active sites. These can be
      set into a small subcollection and searched against your sequence (1)".

      "In some  cases, the structure and function of an unknown protein which
      is too  distantly related  to any  protein of known structure to detect
      its affinity  by overall  sequence alignment  may be  identified by its
      possession of  a particular  cluster of  residues types classified as a
      motifs. The  motifs, or  templates, or  fingerprints, arise  because of
      particular  requirements  of  binding  sites  that  impose  very  tight
      constraint on the evolution of portions of a protein sequence (2)."

   It is common to find that a search of the PROSITE database against a
   protein sequence will report many matches to the short motifs that are
   indicative of the post-translational modification sites, such as
   glycolsylation, myristylation and phosphorylation sites. These reports
   are often unwanted and can optionally be turned off.
   
   Your EMBOSS administrator must have set up the local EMBOSS PROSITE
   database using the utility 'prosextract' before this program will run.

**********************************************
* 11-S plant seed storage proteins signature *
**********************************************

Plant seed storage proteins, whose  principal function appears to be the major
nitrogen  source for the developing plant,  can be classified, on the basis of
their structure, into different families.  11-S are non-glycosylated  proteins
which form hexameric structures [1,2].  Each of the subunits in the hexamer is
itself composed of an acidic and a basic chain derived from a single precursor
and linked  by a  disulfide bond.   This  structure is  shown in the following
representation.

                   +-------------------------+
                   |                         |
        xxxxxxxxxxxCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxNGxCxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
                                          *********
        <------Acidic-subunit-------------^gt;<-----Basic-subunit------>
        <-----------------About-480-to-500-residues----------------->

'C': conserved cysteine involved in a disulfide bond.
'*': position of the pattern.

Proteins that belong to the 11-S family are: pea and broad bean legumins, rape
cruciferin, rice glutelins,  cotton beta-globulins, soybean glycinins, pumpkin
11-S globulin, oat globulin, sunflower helianthinin G3, etc.

As a signature  pattern  for  this  family of proteins we used the region that
includes the  conserved  cleavage  site between  the acidic and basic subunits
(Asn-Gly) and a  proximal cysteine residue which is involved in the interchain
disulfide bond.

-Consensus pattern: N-G-x-[DE](2)-x-[LIVMF]-C-[ST]-x(11,12)-[PAG]-D
                    [C is involved in a disulfide bond]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in SWISS-PROT: NONE.
-Last update: June 1994 / Pattern and text revised.
