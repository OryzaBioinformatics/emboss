Function

   Bending and curvature plot in B-DNA
   
Description

   Banana predicts bending of a normal (B) DNA double helix.
   
   The consensus sequence for DNA bending is 5 As and 5 non-As
   alternating. "N" is an ambiguity code for any base, and "B" is the
   ambiguity code for "not A" so "BANANA" is itself a bent sequence.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with banana.
