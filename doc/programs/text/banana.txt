Function

   Bending and curvature plot in B-DNA
   
Description

   banana predicts bending of a normal (B) DNA double helix, using he
   method of Goodsell & Dickerson, NAR 1994 11;22(24):5497-503.
   
   This program calculates the magnitude of local bending and macroscopic
   curvature at each point along an arbitrary B-DNA sequence, using any
   desired bending model that specifies values of twist, roll and tilt as
   a function of sequence.
   
   The data, based on the nucleosome positioning data of Satchwell et al
   1986 (J. Mol. Biol. 191, 659-675), correctly predicts experimental
   A-tract curvature as measured by gel retardation and cyclization
   kinetics and successfully predicts curvature in regions containing
   phased GGGCCC sequences.
   
   This model - showing local bending at mixed sequence DNA, strong bends
   at the sequence GGC, and straight, rigid A-tracts - is the only model,
   out of six models investigated in Goodsell & Dickerson paper, that is
   consistent with both solution data from gel retardation and
   cyclization kinetics and structural data from x-ray crystallography.
   
   The consensus sequence for DNA bending is 5 As and 5 non-As
   alternating. "N" is an ambiguity code for any base, and "B" is the
   ambiguity code for "not A" so "BANANA" is itself a bent sequence -
   hence the name of this program.
   
   The program outputs both a graphical display and a text file of the
   results.

Output file format

   The output is to both a graphical display and to a text file with the
   default name 'banana.profile'.
   
   The graphical display shows the sequence together with the local local
   bending (solid line) and macroscopic curvature (dotted line).
   
   The output data file from the above example is as follows:

   The data file consists of three columns separated by blanks or tab
   characters.
   
   The first column is the sequence.
   The second column is the local bending.
   The third is the curvature.
   
Data files

   It reads in angles files for the twist, roll and tilt angles. By
   default Eangles_tri.dat is used, as in Goodsell & Dickerson, NAR 1994
   11;22(24):5497-503 and Drew and Travers (1986) JMB 191, 659
   
Notes
