Function

   Plot CpG rich areas
   
Description

   CpG refers to a C nucleotide immediately followed by a G. The 'p' in
   'CpG' refers to the phosphate group linking the two bases.
   
   Detection of regions of genomic sequences that are rich in the CpG
   pattern is important because such regions are resistant to methylation
   and tend to be associated with genes which are frequently switched on.
   Regions rich in the CpG pattern are known as CpG islands.
   
   It has been estimated that about half of all mammalian genes have a
   CpG-rich region around their 5' end. It is said that all mammalian
   house-keeping genes have a CpG island!
   
   Non-mammalian vertebrates have some CpG islands that are associated
   with genes, but the association gets equivocal in the farther
   taxonomic groups.
   
   Finding a CpG island upstream of predicted exons or genes is good
   contributory evidence.
   
   By default, this program defines a CpG island as a region where, over
   an average of 10 windows, the calculated % composition is over 50% and
   the calculated Obs/Exp ratio is over 0.6 and the conditions hold for a
   minimum of 200 bases. These conditions can be modified by setting the
   values of the appropriate parameters.
   
   The Expected number of CpG patterns in a window is calculated as the
   number of 'C's in the window multiplied by the number of 'G's in the
   window, divided by the window length.
   
   This program reads in one or more sequences and calculates the Obs/Exp
   ratio, the percentage CpG over a window which is moved along the
   sequence. These calculated values can be plotted, together with the
   regions which match this program's definition of a CpG island.

   The output file from the above example (rnu68037.cpgplot) follows:

CPGPLOT islands of unusual CG composition
RNU68037 from 51 to 1168

     Observed/Expected ratio > 0.60

   The first non-blank line of the output file is the title of the output
   file. It is followed by the name of the sequence and the region
   analysed (from the centre of the first window to the centre of the
   last window). The conditions for specifying a CpG island follow
   (Observed/Expected ratio, Percent C + Percent G, Length).
   
   The length and start and end positions of any predicted CpG islands
   are then output.
