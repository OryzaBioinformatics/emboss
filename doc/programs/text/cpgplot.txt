Function

   Plot CpG rich areas
   
Description

   CpG refers to a C nucleotide immediately followed by a G. The 'p' in
   'CpG' refers to the phosphate group linking the two bases.
   
   Detection of regions of genomic sequences that are rich in the CpG
   pattern is important because such regions are resistant to methylation
   and tend to be associated with genes which are frequently switched on.
   Regions rich in the CpG pattern are known as CpG islands.
   
   It has been estimated that about half of all mammalian genes have a
   CpG-rich region around their 5' end. It is said that all mammalian
   house-keeping genes have a CpG island!
   
   Non-mammalian vertebrates have some CpG islands that are associated
   with genes, but the association gets equivocal in the farther
   taxonomic groups.
   
   Finding a CpG island upstream of predicted exons or genes is good
   contributory evidence.
   
   By default, this program defines a CpG island as a region where, over
   an average of 10 windows, the calculated % composition is over 50% and
   the calculated Obs/Exp (i.e. Observed/Expected) ratio is over 0.6 and
   the conditions hold for a minimum of 200 bases. These conditions can
   be modified by setting the values of the appropriate parameters.
   
   The Observed number of CpG patterns in a window is simply the count of
   the number of times a 'C' is found followed immediately by a 'G'.
   
   The Expected number of CpG patterns is calculated for each window as
   the number of CpG dinucleotides you would expect to see in that window
   based on the frequency of C's and G's in that window. Thus, the
   Expected frequency of CpG's in a window is calculated as the number of
   'C's in the window multiplied by the number of 'G's in the window,
   divided by the window length.
   
        Expected = (number of C's  * number of G's) / window length


   This program reads in one or more sequences and calculates the Obs/Exp
   ratio, the percentage CpG over a window which is moved along the
   sequence. These calculated values can be plotted, together with the
   regions which match this program's definition of a CpG island.

                                  The window is moved down the sequence and
                                  these statistics are calculated at each

   Program name                          Description
   cpgreport    Reports all CpG rich regions
   geecee       Calculates the fractional GC content of nucleic acid sequences
   newcpgreport Report CpG rich areas
   newcpgseek   Reports CpG rich regions
   
   As there is no official definition of what is a cpg island is, and
   worst where they begin and end, we have to live with 2 definitions and
   thus two methods. These are:
   
   1. newcpgseek and cpgreport - both declare a putative island if the
   score is higher than a threshold (17 at the moment). They now also
   displaying the actual CpG count, the % CG and the observed/expected
   ration in the region where the score is above the threshold. This
   scoring method based on sum/frequencies overpredicts islands but finds
   the smaller ones around primary exons. newcpgseek uses the same method
   as cpgreport but the output is different and more readable.
   
   2. newcpgreport and cpgplot use a sliding window within which the
   Obs/Exp ratio of CpG is calculated. The important thing to note in
   this method is that an island, in order to be reported, is defined as
   a region that satisfies the following contraints:
   
   Obs/Exp ratio > 0.6
   % C + % G > 50%
   Length > 200.

   For all practical purposes you should probably use newcpgreport. It is
   actually used to produce the human cpgisland database you can find on
   the EBI's ftp server as well as on the EBI's SRS server.
   
   geecee measures CG content in the entire input sequence and is not to
   be used to detect CpG islands. It can be usefull for detecting
   sequences that MIGHT contain an island.
