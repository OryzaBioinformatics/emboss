Function

   ACD pretty printing utility

Description

   Acdpretty does not have its own command line. Instead, it will pretty
   print the ACD file of the program specified as the first parameter.

   The program is not run.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with acdpretty


% acdpretty qatest 

Created qatest.acdpretty

   Go to the output files for this example

Command line arguments

   The first parameter is the name of the program to pretty print.

   All other command line parameters and qualifiers are essentially
   ignored as processing stops once the ACD file is printed. A few of the
   general qualifiers have the potential to conflict with the function of
   acdpretty..

Input file format

   The input file is the ACD file for the specified program

Output file format

   The output file is a pretty printed copy of the original ACD file.

   All sections and attributed will be indented. All values will be
   quoted. Lines will be wrapped at a reasonable width.

   The output file is intended as a standard format for parsers used by
   GUI and other interface wrappers, rather than using the original ACD
   file directly.
