Function

   Identify and report CpG-rich regions in nucleotide sequence(s)

Description

   cpgreport identifies in a nucleotide sequence regions with higher than
   expected frequency of the dinucleotide CG.
   Each position in the sequence is scored using a running sum calculated
   from all positions in the sequence. This is a different method to that
   typically used for identifying CpG islands, for example by newcpgreport
   and cpgplot. This method overpredicts islands but finds the smaller
   ones around primary exons. An output file is written with information
   on the CpG-rich regions that are found. A feature table of sequence
   features in these regions is also written.

Algorithm

   cpgreport scores each position in the sequence using a running sum
   calculated from all positions in the sequence, starting with the first
   and ending in the last. If there is not a CG dinucleotide at a
   position, the score is decremented, if there is one, the score is
   incremented by a constant (user-defined) value. If the score for a
   region in the sequence is higher than a threshold (17 at the moment)
   then a putative island is declared. Sequence regions scoring above the
   threshold are searched for recursively.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with cpgreport

   The first non-blank line of the output file 'rnu68037.cpgreport' is the
   title line giving the program name, the name of sequence being analysed
   and the start and end positions of the sequence.

   The second non-blank line contains the headings of the columns.

   Subsequent lines contain columns with the following information:

     * The name of the sequence.
     * The begin position and the end position of the CpG-rich region.
     * The score of the CpG-rich region.
     * The number of CpG's in the CpG-rich region.
     * The %(G+C) in the CpG-rich region.
     * The ratio of CpG to GpC in the CpG-rich region.

   If the count of GpC in the region is zero, then the ratio of CG/GC is
   reported as '-'.

Notes

   "CpG" refers to a C nucleotide immediately followed by a G. The 'p' in
   'CpG' refers to the phosphate group linking the two bases. Regions of
   genomic sequences rich in the CpG pattern or "CpG islands" are
   resistant to methylation and tend to be associated with genes which are
   frequently switched on. It's been estimated that about half of all
   mammalian genes, and, possibly all mammalian house-keeping genes, have
   a CpG-rich region around their 5' end. Non-mammalian vertebrates have
   some CpG islands that are associated with genes, but the association
   gets equivocal in the farther taxonomic groups. The detection of CpG
   island upstream of predicted exons or genes is evidence in support of a
   highly expressed gene.

   As there is no official definition of what is a CpG island is or how to
   identify where they begin and end, we work with two definitions and
   thus two methods. These are:

   1. cpgplot and newcpgreport use a sliding window within which the
   Observed/Expected ratio of CpG is calculated. For a sequence region to
   reported as a CpG island, it must satisfy the following contraints:
   Observed/Expected ratio > 0.6
   % C + % G > 50%
   Sequence Length > 200

   2. newcpgseek and cpgreport use a running sum calculated from all
   positions in a sequence rather than a window to produce a score. If
   there is not a CG dinucleotide at a position, the score is decremented,
   if there is one, the score is incremented by a constant (user-defined)
   value. If the score for a region in the sequence is higher than a
   threshold (17 at the moment) then a putative island is declared.
   Sequence regions scoring above the threshold are searched for
   recursively.

   This method overpredicts islands but finds the smaller ones around
   primary exons. newcpgseek uses the same method as cpgreport but the
   output is different and more readable. For most purposes you should
   probably use newcpgreport rather than cpgreport. It is used to produce
   the human cpgisland database you can find on the EBI's ftp server as
   well as on the EBI's SRS server.

   newcpgseek and cpgreport both now display the actual CpG count, the (%C
   + %G) and the Observed/Expected ratio in the region where the score is
   above the threshold.

   The geecee program measures CG content in the entire input sequence and
   is not to be used to detect CpG islands. It can be useful for detecting
   sequences that MIGHT contain an island.

   As there is no official definition of what is a cpg island is, and
   worst where they begin and end, we have to live with 2 definitions and
   thus two methods. These are:

   1. newcpgseek and cpgreport - both declare a putative island if the
   score is higher than a threshold (17 at the moment). They now also
   displaying the actual CpG count, the % CG and the observed/expected
   ration in the region where the score is above the threshold. This
   scoring method based on sum/frequencies overpredicts islands but finds
   the smaller ones around primary exons. newcpgseek uses the same method
   as cpgreport but the output is different and more readable.

   2. newcpgreport and cpgplot use a sliding window within which the
   Obs/Exp ratio of CpG is calculated. The important thing to note in this
   method is that an island, in order to be reported, is defined as a
   region that satisfies the following contraints:

   Obs/Exp ratio > 0.6
   % C + % G > 50%
   Length > 200.

   For all practical purposes you should probably use newcpgreport. It is
   actually used to produce the human cpgisland database you can find on
   the EBI's ftp server as well as on the EBI's SRS server.

   geecee measures CG content in the entire input sequence and is not to
   be used to detect CpG islands. It can be usefull for detecting
   sequences that MIGHT contain an island.
