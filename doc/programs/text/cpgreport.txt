Function

   Reports all CpG rich regions
   
Description

   cpgreport scans a nucleotide sequence for regions with higher than
   expected frequencies of the dinucleotide CG.
   
   CpG refers to a C nucleotide immediately followed by a G. The 'p' in
   'CpG' refers to the phosphate group linking the two bases.
   
   Detection of regions of genomic sequences that are rich in the CpG
   pattern is important because such regions are resistant to methylation
   and tend to be associated with genes which are frequently switched on.
   Regions rich in the CpG pattern are known as CpG islands.
   
   This program does not find CpG islands as normally defined: "a region
   of greater than 200 bp with a %GC of greater than 50% and
   observed/expected CpG > 0.6". cpgreport instead uses a running sum
   rather than a window to create the score as follows: if not CpG at
   position i, then decrement running-Sum counter, but if CpG then
   running-Sum counter is incremented by the CPGSCORE. Spans greater than
   the threshold are searched for recursively.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with cpgreport.

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
   -score              integer    This sets the score for each CG sequence
                                  found. A value of 17 is more sensitive, but
                                  28 has also been used with some success.
  [-outfile]           outfile    Output file name

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers:

Output file format

   The output file from the above example (rnu68037.cpgreport) follows:

CPGREPORT of RNU68037 from 1 to 1218

   The first non-blank line of the output file is the title line giving
   the program name, the name of sequence being analysed and the start
   and end positions of the sequence.
   
   The second non-blank line contains the headings of teh columns.
   
   Subsequent lines contain columns with the following information:
     * The name of the sequence.
     * The begin position and the end position of the CpG-rich region.
     * The score of the CpG-rich region.
     * The number of CpG's in the CpG-rich region.
     * The %(G+C) in the CpG-rich region.
     * The ratio of CpG to GpC in the CpG-rich region.
       
   If the count of GpC in the region is zero, then the ratio of CG/GC is
   reported as '-'.
