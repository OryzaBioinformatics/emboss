     _________________________________________________________________
   
                                 Program emnu
                                       
Function

   Simple menu of EMBOSS applications
   
Description

   emnu displays a simple character-based menu that allows you to display
   the names of emboss programs and select them.
   
   It also displays the names of files in your current directory and
   allows you to display their contents, copy them, delete them and do
   other things with them.
   
   emnu allows to to move around the menus of programs or files using the
   arrow keys. Pressing RETURN when you have selected an item will run a
   program or display a file.
   
   You can also navigate around the menu by typing the first few letters
   of the option that you desire. You will move to the item in the menu
   that first matches those letters.
   
   You can also type in UNIX commands as if you were typing them in a
   UNIX session. (Of course, as you type, emnu will not know if you wish
   to run a UNIX command or go to a menu item starting with the letters
   you are typing, so you will see the menu selection changing as you
   type. If this irritates you and you are confident enough with UNIX
   commands to be typing them directly, maybe you do not need to use
   emnu?)
   
   If you run a command or program that creates one or more files, then
   when you return to the menu, the command line will be set up to
   contain the command more followed by the names of the files. Pressing
   RETURN to run this command will display the contents of these files.
   If you do not wish to see these files, just press ^C to clear the
   command line.
   
   You can also navigate around the menu and do many other things by
   typing control keys and Function keys. Control keys can be typed by
   pressing the Control key and another key. Control keys are written
   here and in the online help text as a ^ and then the key's letter, for
   example ^C means Control-C.
   
   The control key commands that are most useful will be displayed in the
   bottom two lines of the screen. If in doubt, press the '?' key for
   further help.
   
   If you are using emnu through a telnet session or in a 'xterm' window,
   you may be able to click on menu options and on the bottom two lines
   of help in the screen to select items. (Double click on the menu to
   run that item.)
   
   The menus that are displayed are very simple. They consist of the
   title of the menu at the top of the screen, followed by several lines
   of things to select. The first two items are always 'EXIT' which takes
   you back to the previous menu, and 'HELP' which shows help for this
   menu.
   
   The first menu you see (the GROUPS MENU) will consist of two columns
   of the groups of EMBOSS programs. You can move up and down, left and
   right using the arrow keys. The bottom two lines show useful control
   keys you can type to do things. You may be able to click on the help
   text or on the menu items to select them.
   
   The line above the two help lines is the command line. This is where
   the currently selected menu item or any command you type is displayed.
   See the Usage section of this document below to see useful control
   codes for navigating and editing this command line. You may type in
   any UNIX command or any EMBOSS program name in this command line. It
   is common to add extra parameters or options to change the default
   behaviour of an EMBOSS program. You may edit the command line to do
   this. For example the program seqret can take many options. You may
   wish to type the command 'seqret -osf gcg' to make seqret write out
   sequences in GCG format.
   
   Selecting any item in the GROUPS menu apart from 'EXIT' and 'HELP'
   will select a sub-menu. The 'ALL FILES' and 'NEW FILES' items will
   start a menu displaying files, all others will display a menu of
   EMBOSS programs.
   
  Groups menu
  
   This is the menu that is initially displayed.

                                  MAIN MENU HELP
This menu system aims to make it easy to run EMBOSS programs and manage files.

You now have a menu of EMBOSS program groups. You can select any program group
and select the programs. Move to an option and press RETURN to select it.
You can move to menu options by typing the first few letters of the option name
or by using the cursor (arrow) keys.
You can also type any normal UNIX command and run it.

Before the program group options, are the following special options:
EXIT - exit the program
HELP - this page of help
ALL FILES - display files in this directory, view them, change directory, etc.
NEW FILES - display the files that have been created since 'em' started running
ALPHABETIC - listing of all EMBOSS programs
SEARCH - search for EMBOSS programs by name or description

The following control keys edit the command line:
^F forward, ^B back, ^A start, ^E end, ^C delete line, ^K delete to end of line

The following keys get other things:
F1,F2,F3,F5 -view, view sequence, copy and delete the last file looked at
^X exit, ^N/^T file menus, ^R recall stored file, TAB complete name of option

Press any key to continue...
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Programs menus
  
   A typical EMBOSS PROGRAMS MENU is displayed below.
   
   It starts with the normal 'EXIT' and 'HELP' items. All the other items
   are EMBOSS programs. There is only one column of items. Each item is
   followed by a short description of the program. Use of the UP and DOWN
   arrow keys will move you up and down in the menu. Use of the LEFT and
   RIGHT arrow keys will also move you up and down in the menu.
   
   To get back to the GROUPS MENU, select the 'EXIT' option or type ^X.
   
   You may add any text you wish after the name of a selected EMBOSS
   program. For example, type ^E to go to the end of the command line and
   type -opt after the program name to make the program ask you for more
   than the minimal set of qualifiers when you run that program.
   
   To see detailed help on a program, move to the appropriate item and
   press the ? key.
   
   If you run a program that creates one or more files, then when you
   return to the menu, the command line will be set up to contain the
   command more followed by the names of the files. Pressing RETURN to
   run this command will display the contents of these files. If you do
   not wish to see these files, just press ^C to clear the command line.
   
   To run the program, just press RETURN.
   
   NOTE: Once you start running any program, you are no longer talking to
   the menu system, you are only talking to that program. Therefore all
   of the control codes for doing things like putting file names in the
   command line will have no effect.

Press any key to continue...
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  All files menu
  
   Get to this menu by selecting the 'ALL FILES' option from the main
   GROUPS menu, or type ^T in any menu.
   
   This will show a list of the files in your current directory (folder).
   
   The name of the current directory will be displayed as the title of
   the menu.
   
   You can see the contents of a file by pressing RETURN when the file is
   the currently selected item in the menu. If the current item is a
   directory (marked by the word Dir by the name) then you will go into
   that directory and the FILES menu will change to display the files in
   that directory. All further programs will be run in that new directory
   until you exit the menu program or you change directory again. Exiting
   from the FILES menu will not change back to the previous menu.
   
   There are many useful control keys for manipulating files:
   
   The following change the way the files are sorted before displaying in
   the menu. Having pressed one of these function keys, all subsequent
   file menus will sort the files using the appropriate method.
   
 F8  AlphaSort
     Sort the files by name (Start a files menu if not already in one)

 F9  TimeSort
     Sort the files by time (Start a files menu if not already in one)

   The following will use the current files menu item to display, copy of
   delete. If you are not currently in a FILES menu or if the current
   item is not a file, then the last valid file that you pressed RETURN
   on will be remembered and used.
   
   The ^G key is useful for adding this default file name to a command
   you are typing into the command line.
   
   Note: you can use the commands in any menu and they will work on the
   default file.
   
 F1  ViewFile
     Show the contents of the current menu item file, or last file viewed

 F2  View Seq
     Display the current file as a sequence

 F4  CopyFile
     Copy the current file to a new file

 F5  DelFile
     Delete the current file

 ^G  GetFile
     Add the name of the current file to the command line

   Separate from the memory of the default file used by the above
   commands is a specific method of remembering the name of an item in
   the FILES menus and recalling it into the command line at a later date
   by using the following pair of key codes.
   
 ^S  StoreFile
     Remember the name of the current menu item file

 ^R  RecalFile
     Add the stored file name to the command line

   And finally, it is often useful to be able to make a new directory
   (folder) and go directly into that new directory.
   
 F3  New Dir
     Create a new directory and go into it

  New files menu
  
   The NEW FILES menu is exactly the same at the ALL FILES menu except
   that it only holds those files that have been created or modified
   since you started the menu program.
   
   It therefore consists of a convenient way of quickly finding those
   files which you have worked on during this menu session.

   -explode            bool       The groups that EMBOSS applications belong
                                  to have two forms, exploded and not
                                  exploded. The exploded group names are more
                                  numerous and often vaguely phrased than the
                                  non-exploded ones. The exploded names are
                                  formed from definitions of the group names
                                  that start like NAME1:NAME2 and which are
                                  then expanded into many combinations of the
                                  names as: 'NAME1', 'NAME2', 'NAME1 NAME2',
                                  NAME2 NAME1'. The non-expanded names are
                                  simply like: 'NAME1 NAME2'.

   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   
   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default

   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -[no]morefiles After every command that you run in the menu, either by
   selecting the name of an EMBOSS program, or by typing the command in
   the command line, a check is made to see if any new files have been

   Yes
   -explode The groups that EMBOSS applications belong to have two forms,

Notes

   The name of this program, emnu, comes from the observation that 'emnu'
   is a mangled 'menu'.
   
References

   None.
   
Warnings

   None.
   
Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.
   
Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.
   
Known bugs

   It crashes if you resize the xterm window to make it smaller than when
   the menu system started.
   
   When using the '-explode' option, one of the program groups is
   expanded to be 'HELP'. Selecting this option simply gives the help for
   the Groups Menu. I don't intend to alter this situation, it is a
   feature.
   
   delete_file() doesn't delete directories - this is because we don't
   allow directories to be default files. Should we? It would complicate
   things like copy_file.

History

   Many concepts (but no code) for this application cames from the editor
   pico and the file browser 'Midnight Commander' (mc).
   
   Code was taken liberally from the example programs in the ncurses
   package.
   
   The name of this program, emnu, was a suggestion from Peter Rice after
   the author had run through many temporary names ('esme' - Extremely
   Simple Menu for EMBOSS, 'em' - EMBOSS Menu, 'm' - Menu).
