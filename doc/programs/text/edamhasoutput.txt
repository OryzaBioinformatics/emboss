Function

   Find EDAM ontology terms by has_output relation

Description

   edamhasoutput searches the has_output relations of EDAM terms and
   returns matching terms. The input is read from the installed EDAM
   database. The ontology term output can be written to screen, to file,
   or passed to another program. A wide range of standard ontology term
   formats may be specified for input and output.

   Optionally the search can be restricted to specified EDAM namespaces.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with edamhasoutput

Command line arguments

Find EDAM ontology terms by has_output relation
Version: EMBOSS:6.4.0.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-identifier]        string     Identifier(s) to search for in ontology (Any
                                  string)
  [-outfile]           outobo     [*.edamhasoutput] Output ontology term file
                                  name

   Additional (Optional) qualifiers:
   -namespace          menu       [*] By default all terms are returned.
                                  Searches can be limited to one or a few
                                  namespaces. (Values: data (Data entity);
                                  entity (Biological entity); format (Data
                                  format); identifier (Identifier); operation
                                  (Bioinformatics operation); resource (Data
                                  resource); topic (Field of bioinformatics
                                  study))

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -sensitive          boolean    [N] By default, the query keywords are
                                  matched against the EDAM term names (and
                                  synonyms) only. This option also matches the
                                  keywords against the EDAM term definitions
                                  and will therefore (typically) report more
                                  matches.
   -subclasses         boolean    [N] Extend the query matches to include all
                                  terms which are specialisations (EDAM
                                  sub-classes) of the matched type.
   -obsolete           boolean    [N] The default behaviour is to not use or
                                  return obsolete terms. This option if set
                                  will include all terms.

   Associated qualifiers:

   "-outfile" associated qualifiers
   -odirectory2        string     Output directory
   -oformat2           string     Ontology term output format

   General qualifiers:
   -auto               boolean    Turn off prompts
   -stdout             boolean    Write first file to standard output
   -filter             boolean    Read first file from standard input, write
                                  first file to standard output
   -options            boolean    Prompt for standard and additional values
   -debug              boolean    Write debug output to program.dbg
   -verbose            boolean    Report some/full command line options
   -help               boolean    Report command line options and exit. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   -warning            boolean    Report warnings
   -error              boolean    Report errors
   -fatal              boolean    Report fatal errors
   -die                boolean    Report dying program messages
   -version            boolean    Report version number and exit


Input file format

   edamhasoutput queries the EDAM ontology.

Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS ontology term file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -oformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: obo,
   brief, list, html, xml, json, excel.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/OntologyFormats.html for further
   information on ontology formats.
