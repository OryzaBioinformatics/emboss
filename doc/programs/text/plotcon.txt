Function

   Plot quality of conservation of a sequence alignment

Description

   Displays a graphical representation of the similarity along a set of
   aligned sequences.

   The similarity is calculated by moving a window of a specified length
   along the aligned sequences. Within the window, the similarity of any
   one position is taken to be the average of all the possible pairwise
   scores of the bases or residues at that position. The pairwise scores
   are taken from the specified similarity matrix. The average of the
   position similarities within the window is plotted.

   The program is useful for determining where the quality of alignments
   is good or bad.

   The average similarity is calculated by:

Av. Sim. =       sum( Mij*wi + Mji*wj  )
                      -------------------
                  (Nseq*Wsize)*((Nseq-1)*Wsize)

   sum - over column*window size
   w - sequence weighting
   M - matrix comparison table
   i,j - with respect to residue i or j
   Nseq - number of sequences in the alignment
   Wsize - window size

   This program is useful for gaining a qualitative insight into where
   there are regions of conservation in a group of aligned sequences.

   Note that you should only compare the results of two runs of plotcon
   if you use the same window size in each. This is because the
   'similarity score' units that are output are very sensitive to the
   size of the window. A large window (e.g. 100) gives a nice, smooth
   curve, and very low 'similarity score' units, whereas a small window
   (e.g. 4) gives a very spikey, noisy plot with 'similarity score' units
   of a round 1.00

Output file format

   A graph of the quality of the alignment is dispalyed on the specifed
   graphics device.

Data files

   It reads in the specified similarity matrix.

   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.

   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:

% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".

   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata

Notes

   None.

References

   None.

Warnings

   If you give it a set of unaligned sequences, it will plot the (poor!)
   quality of these as if they were aligned.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.

Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.

Known bugs

   None.
