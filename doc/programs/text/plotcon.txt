Function

   Plots the quality of conservation of a sequence alignment
   
Description

   Displays a graphical representation of the similarity along a set of
   aligned sequences.
   
   The similarity is calculated by moving a window of a specified length
   along the aligned sequences. Within the window, the similarity of any
   one position is taken to be the average of all the possible pairwise
   scores of the bases or residues at that position. The pairwise scores
   are taken from the specified similarity matrix. The average of the
   position similarities within the window is plotted.
   
   The program is useful for determining where the quality of alignments
   is good or bad.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with plotcon:

% plotcon -sformat msf alignment.msf

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
  [-msf]               seqset     File containing a sequence alignment
   -winsize            integer    Number of columns to average alignment
                                  quality over. The larger this value is, the
                                  smoother the plot will be.
*  -graph              xygraph    Graph type
*  -outfile            outfile    Display as data

   Optional qualifiers:
   -scorefile          matrix     This is the scoring matrix file used when
                                  comparing sequences. By default it is the
                                  file 'EBLOSUM62' (for proteins) or the file
                                  'EDNAFULL' (for nucleic sequences). These
                                  files are found in the 'data' directory of
                                  the EMBOSS installation.

   Advanced qualifiers:
   -data               boolean    Output the match data to a file instead of
                                  plotting it

   General qualifiers:
  -help                boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-msf]
   (Parameter 1) File containing a sequence alignment Readable sequences
   Required
   -winsize Number of columns to average alignment quality over. The
   larger this value is, the smoother the plot will be. Any integer value
   4
   -graph Graph type EMBOSS has a list of known devices, including
   postscript, ps, hpgl, hp7470, hp7580, meta, colourps, cps, xwindows,
   x11, tektronics, tekt, tek4107t, tek, none, null, text, data, xterm,
   png EMBOSS_GRAPHICS value, or x11
   -outfile Display as data Output file <sequence>.plotcon
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -scorefile This is the scoring matrix file used when comparing
   sequences. By default it is the file 'EBLOSUM62' (for proteins) or the
   file 'EDNAFULL' (for nucleic sequences). These files are found in the
   'data' directory of the EMBOSS installation. Comparison matrix file in
   EMBOSS data path EBLOSUM62 for protein
   EDNAFULL for DNA
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -data Output the match data to a file instead of plotting it Yes/No No
   
Input file format

   A set of gapped, aligned sequences.
   
Output file format

   A graph of the quality of the alignment is plotted.
   
Data files

   It reads in the specified similarity matrix.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by the EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   To see the available EMBOSS data files, run:
   
% embossdata -showall

   To fetch one of the data files (for example 'Exxx.dat') into your
   current directory for you to inspect or modify, run:

% embossdata -fetch -file Exxx.dat

   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
       
Notes

   None.
   
References

   None.
   
Warnings

   If you give it a set of unaligned sequences, it will plot the (poor!)
   quality of these as if they were aligned.
   
Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.
   
Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.
   
Known bugs

   None.
