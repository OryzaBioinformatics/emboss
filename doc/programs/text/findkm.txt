Function

   Find Km and Vmax for an enzyme reaction by a Hanes/Woolf plot
   
Description

   Takes a file of enzymatic data and plots Michaelis Menten and Hanes
   Woolf plots of the data. From these ot calculates the Michaelis Menten
   constant (Km) and the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the reaction.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with findkm.

%findkm
Calculates Km and Vmax for an enzyme reaction.

Input file format

   The input file is a file of enzymatic data, [S] against V, Substrate
   concentration against reaction velocity.
   
   The data for the example run are shown below:

  0.10   2
  0.20   4
  0.50   9
  1.00  17
  2.00  29
  5.00  50
 10.00  67
 20.00  80
 50.00  91
100.00  95


Output file format

   Here is a sample output from the example above, together with the
   plots:

---Hanes Woolf Plot Calculations---
Slope of best fit line is a = 0.01
Coefficient in Eqn of line y = ma +b is b = 0.05
Where line cuts x axis = (-0.20, 0)
Where line cuts y axis = (0, 0.05)
Limit-point of graph for plot = (103.00, 1.08)

Vmax = 99.70, Km = 4.894612
