Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-querysequence]     sequence   First (query) polypeptide sequence to be
                                  aligned
  [-templatesequence]  sequence   Second (template) polypeptide sequence to be
                                  aligned
  [-contactscoringfile] matrixf    Matrix of scores for frequency of contacts
                                  between specific amino acid residue types
  [-cmaptemplate]      infile     contact map of template structure
   -gapopen            float      The gap opening penalty is subtracted from
                                  the total score every time a gap is inserted
                                  in the alignment. The default value is
                                  chosen for the EBLOSUM62 scoring matrix when
                                  you are aligning protein sequences, and the
                                  EDNAFULL matrix when you are aligning
                                  nucleotide sequences. If you sequence
                                  contains many small errors you should set a
                                  low gap opening penalty (near zero) to avoid
                                  over-penalizing those errors.
   -gapextend          float      The gap extension penalty is the score
                                  substracted when more spaces are added to an
                                  existing alignment gap. Often a single
                                  insertion or deletion affects multiple
                                  residues/nucleotides; separate opening and
                                  extension penalties reduce the excessive
                                  penalty such events would otherwise carry;
                                  generally the gap extension penalty should
                                  be significantly lower than the gap opening
                                  penalty.
  [-verticaltrace]     outfile    vertical trace of initial alignment
  [-alignedoutfile]    seqout     Output sequence USA

   Advanced (Unprompted) qualifiers:
   -[no]zeroend        boolean    If this option is true then no penalty is

   -gapopen The gap opening penalty is subtracted from the total score
   every time a gap is inserted in the alignment. The default value is
   chosen for the EBLOSUM62 scoring matrix when you are aligning protein
   sequences, and the EDNAFULL matrix when you are aligning nucleotide
   sequences. If you sequence contains many small errors you should set a

   -gapextend The gap extension penalty is the score substracted when
   more spaces are added to an existing alignment gap. Often a single

   should be significantly lower than the gap opening penalty. Floating
