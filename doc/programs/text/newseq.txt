Function

   Type in a short new sequence
   
Description

   This allows you to type a sequence into a file in a quick and easy
   manner.
   
   The length of the sequence you can type in is restricted to a fairly
   short length (typically less than 255 characters). This length
   restriction is not a property of the EMBOSS package, but of the
   computer system you are using. This is because, as you type in
   response to a prompt from this program, what you type is stored in the
   computer operating system before being handed over to the program.
   There is often a limit of less than 255 characters on the length of a
   response that a computer system will allow you to give.
   
   Despite this restriction, it is expected that this program will be a
   useful and easy way of constructing new sequence files.
   
   (You wouldn't want to type a long sequence in by hand, anyway, would
   you?)
   
Usage

   Type in a short sequence to the file 'mycc.pep' in EMBL format:
   
% newseq
Type in a short new sequence.
Output sequence [outfile.fasta]: embl::mycc.pep
Name of the sequence: cytoc
Description of the sequence: fragment of cytochrome C
Type of sequence

         N : Nucleic
         P : Protein
Type of sequence [N]: p
Enter the sequence: KKKEERADLIAY

   Display the resulting new file:
   
% more mycc.pep
ID   cytoc          STANDARD;      PRT;    12 AA.
DE   fragment of cytochrome C
SQ   SEQUENCE    12 AA;   1464 MW;  2BF1DB53 CRC32;
     KKKEERADLI AY

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-outseq]            seqout     Output sequence USA
  [-name]              string     The name of of the sequence should be a
                                  single word that you will use to identify
                                  the sequence. It should have no (or few)
                                  punctuation characters in it.
  [-description]       string     Enter any description of the sequence that
                                  you require.
  [-type]              menu       Type of sequence
  [-sequence]          string     The sequence itself.
                                  Because of the limitation of the operating
                                  system, you will only be able to type in a
                                  short sequence of (typically) 250
                                  characters, or so.
                                  The keyboard will beep at you when you have
                                  reached this limit and you will not be able
                                  to press the RETURN/ENTER key until you have
                                  deleted a few characters.

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   General qualifiers:
  -help                bool       report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default

   (Parameter 1) Output sequence USA Writeable sequence <sequence>.format
   [-name]
   (Parameter 2) The name of of the sequence should be a single word that
   you will use to identify the sequence. It should have no (or few)
   punctuation characters in it. Any string is accepted An empty string
   is accepted
   [-description]
   (Parameter 3) Enter any description of the sequence that you require.
   Any string is accepted An empty string is accepted
   [-type]
   (Parameter 4) Type of sequence
   N (Nucleic)
   P (Protein)
   N
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 5) The sequence itself. Because of the limitation of the
   operating system, you will only be able to type in a short sequence of
   (typically) 250 characters, or so. The keyboard will beep at you when
   you have reached this limit and you will not be able to press the
   RETURN/ENTER key until you have deleted a few characters. Any string
   is accepted An empty string is accepted

Notes

   The length of the sequence you can type in is restricted to a fairly
   short length (typically less than 255 characters). If your computer
   beeps at you, you will typically have to delete the last character you
   typed and press the RETURN key.
