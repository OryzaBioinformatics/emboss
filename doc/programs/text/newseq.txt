Function

   Create a sequence file from a typed-in sequence

Description

   newseq creates a sequence file from a sequence that is manually typed
   in at the command-line. This is a quicker, easier and less error-prone
   method than editing such a file in a text editor.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with newseq

   Type in a short sequence to the file 'mycc.pep' in SWISSPROT format:


% newseq 
Create a sequence file from a typed-in sequence
Name of the sequence: cytoc
Description of the sequence: fragment of cytochrome c
Type of sequence
         N : Nucleic
         P : Protein
Type of sequence [N]: p
Enter the sequence: KKKEERADLIAY
output sequence [outfile.fasta]: swiss::mycc.pep

   Go to the output files for this example

Command line arguments

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-name]              string     The name of of the sequence should be a
                                  single word that you will use to identify
                                  the sequence. It should have no (or few)
                                  punctuation characters in it. (Any string is
                                  accepted)
  [-description]       string     Enter any description of the sequence that
                                  you require. (Any string is accepted)
  [-type]              menu       [N] Type of sequence (Values: N (Nucleic); P
                                  (Protein))
  [-sequence]          string     The sequence itself.
                                  Because of the limitation of the operating
                                  system, you will only be able to type in a
                                  short sequence of (typically) 250
                                  characters, or so.
                                  The keyboard will beep at you when you have
                                  reached this limit and you will not be able
                                  to press the RETURN/ENTER key until you have
                                  deleted a few characters. (Any string is
                                  accepted)
  [-outseq]            seqout     [.] Sequence filename and
                                  optional format (output USA)

Input file format

Output file format

   newseq writes a normal sequence file.

  Output files for usage example

  File: mycc.pep

ID   cytoc                   Unreviewed;          12 AA.
DE   fragment of cytochrome c
SQ   SEQUENCE   12 AA;  1464 MW;  6F142FA88DADC40B CRC64;
     KKKEERADLI AY
//

Data files

   None.

Notes

   The length of the sequence you can type in is restricted to a fairly
   short length (typically less than 255 characters). If your computer
   beeps at you, you will typically have to delete the last character you
   typed and press the RETURN key.

References

   None.

Warnings

   There will be a maximum permissible length (typically 255 characters)
   of the sequence that may be entered. This is not a property of the
   EMBOSS package but of the computer system you are using. Whenever you
   type something in at the command-line, the text is stored in a buffer
   before being passed to the program. There is often a limit of less
   than 255 characters on the size of the buffer and so also the size of
   the sequence you can specify to newseq. The computer will normally
   issue a beep when the end of buffer is reached, and allow no more
   character input.

Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.

Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.

Known bugs

   None.
