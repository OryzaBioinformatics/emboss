                                  Program iep
                                       
Function

   Calculates the isoelectric point of a protein
   
Description

   This calculates the isoelectric point of a protein from its amino acid
   composition assuming that no electrostatic interactions change the
   propensity for ionization.
   
   Adjusting the pH of an aqueous protein solution to the point where the
   numbers of positive and negative charges on the protein are equal
   brings the protein to its isoelectric point. This is often the point
   of lowest solubility, presumably because it is the point at which
   there are fewest intermolecular repulsions, so that the molecules tend
   to form aggregates.
   
   The application can make a plot of the ionization curve with respect
   to pH and can write an output file of the data.
