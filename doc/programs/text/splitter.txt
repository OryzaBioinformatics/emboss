                               Program splitter
                                       
Function

   Split a sequence into (overlapping) smaller sequences
   
Description

   This simple editing program allows you to split a long sequence into
   smaller, optionally overlapping, subsequences.
   
Usage

   To split a sequence into sub-sequences of 10,000 bases (the default
   size) with no overlap between the sub-sequences:
        % splitter one_huge.seq many_small.seq

   To split a sequence into sub-sequences of 50,000 bases with an overlap
   of 3,000 bases on each sub-sequence.
        % splitter one_huge.seq many_small.seq -size=50000 -over=3000

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
  [-outseq]            seqoutall  Output sequence(s) USA

   Optional qualifiers:
   -size               integer    Size to split at
   -overlap            integer    Overlap between split sequences

   Advanced qualifiers: (none)

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   [-outseq]
   (Parameter 2) Output sequence(s) USA Writeable sequence(s)
   <sequence>.format
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -size Size to split at Any integer value 10000
   -overlap Overlap between split sequences Any integer value 0
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input File Format

   One or more sequences
   
Output File Format

   Many sequences.
   
   The names of the sequences are the same as the original sequence, with
   '_start-end' appended, where 'start', and 'end' are the start and end
   positions of the sub-sequence. eg: The name HSHBB would be changed in
   the sub-sequences to: HSHBB_1-50000 and HSHBB_50001-73308 if they were
   split at the size of 50000 with no overlap.
   
Data files

   None.
   
Notes

   There should be little requirement to split sequences into smaller
   sub-sequences in EMBOSS, but there may be circumstances where memory
   usage becomes restrictive when dealing with truly large sequences.
