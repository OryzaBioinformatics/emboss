                                  consensus.If any of these give a top score

   has occurred. 2) If another residue has a greater than or equal to
   matching score and these do not match then a collision has occurred.
   3) Checks all those not in the current consensus.If any of these give
   a top score for matching or identical scores then a collision has
   occured. Integer from 0 to 3 0

   -data (no help text) bool value Yes/No No
   
Input file format

   Any sequence USA.
   
Output file format

   An image of the alignment is displayed.
   
Data files

   Prettyplot uses a comparison matrix file to calculate similarity to
   the consensus.
   
   For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution matrix.
   For nucleotide sequence, EDNAFULL is used.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
       
Notes

   None.
   
References

   None.
   
Warnings

   None.
   
Diagnostic Error Messages

   None.
   
Exit status

   It exits with status 0 unless an error is reported.
   
Known bugs

   Portrait mode does not cover the whole page! This is a "feature" in
   plplot.

Author(s)

   This application was written by Ian Longden (il@sanger.ac.uk)
   Informatics Division, The Sanger Centre, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus,
   Hinxton, Cambridge, CB10 1SA, UK.
   
   Many features were first implemented in the EGCG program "prettyplot"
   by Peter Rice.
   
   The original suggestions for the PrettyPlot program were from Denis
   Duboule and Sigfried Labeit at EMBL. Gert Vriend added the star
   marking. Rita Grandori suggested the -NOCOLLISION option.
   
History

   Completed 5th May 1999.
   
Target users

   This program is intended to be used by everyone and everything, from
   naive users to embedded scripts.
