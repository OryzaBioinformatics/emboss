Function

   Distances between two sets of trees

Description

   Computes the Branch Score distance between trees, which allows for
   differences in tree topology and which also makes use of branch
   lengths. Also computes the Robinson-Foulds symmetric difference
   distance between trees, which allows for differences in tree topology
   but does not use branch lengths.

Algorithm

   This program computes distances between trees. Two distances are
   computed, the Branch Score Distance of Kuhner and Felsenstein (1994),
   and the more widely known Symmetric Difference of Robinson and Foulds
   (1981). The Branch Score Distance uses branch lengths, and can only be
   calculated when the trees have lengths on all branches. The Symmetric
   Difference does not use branch length information, only the tree
   topologies. It must also be borne in mind that neither distance has
   any immediate statistical interpretation -- we cannot say whether a
   larger distance is significantly larger than a smaller one.

   These distances are computed by considering all possible branches that
   could exist on the the two trees. Each branch divides the set of
   species into two groups -- the ones connected to one end of the branch
   and the ones connected to the other. This makes a partition of the
   full set of species. (in Newick notation)

  ((A,C),(D,(B,E)))

   has two internal branches. One induces the partition {A, C | B, D, E}
   and the other induces the partition {A, C, D | B, E}. A different tree
   with the same set of species,

  (((A,D),C),(B,E))

   has internal branches that correspond to the two partitions {A, C, D |
   B, E} and {A, D | B, C, E}. Note that the other branches, all of which
   are external branches, induce partitions that separate one species
   from all the others. Thus there are 5 partitions like this: {C | A, B,
   D, E} on each of these trees. These are always present on all trees,
   provided that each tree has each species at the end of its own branch.

   In the case of the Branch Score distance, each partition that does
   exist on a tree also has a branch length associated with it. Thus if
   the tree is

  (((A:0.1,D:0.25):0.05,C:0.01):0.2,(B:0.3,E:0.8):0.2)

   The list of partitions and their branch lengths is:

{A  |  B, C, D, E}     0.1
{D  |  A, B, C, E}     0.25
{A, D  |  B, C, E}     0.05
{C  |  A, B, D, E}     0.01
{A, D, C  |  B, E}     0.4
{B  |  A, C, D, E}     0.3
{E  |  A, B, C, D}     0.8

   Note that the tree is being treated as unrooted here, so that the
   branch lengths on either side of the rootmost node are summed up to
   get a branch length of 0.4.

   The Branch Score Distance imagines us as having made a list of all
   possible partitions, the ones shown above and also all 7 other
   possible partitions, which correspond to branches that are not found
   in this tree. These are assigned branch lengths of 0. For two trees,
   we imagine constructing these lists, and then summing the squared
   differences between the branch lengths. Thus if both trees have
   branches {A, D | B, C, E}, the sum contains the square of the
   difference between the branch lengths. If one tree has the branch and
   the other doesn't, it contains the square of the difference between
   the branch length and zero (in other words, the square of that branch
   length). If both trees do not have a particular branch, nothing is
   added to the sum because the difference is then between 0 and 0.

   The Branch Score Distance takes this sum of squared differences and
   computes its square root. Note that it has some desirable properties.
   When small branches differ in tree topology, it is not very big. When
   branches are both present but differ in length, it is affected.

   The Symmetric Difference is simply a count of how many partitions
   there are, among the two trees, that are on one tree and not on the
   other. In the example above there are two partitions, {A, C | B, D, E}
   and {A, D | B, C, E}, each of which is present on only one of the two
   trees. The Symmetric Difference between the two trees is therefore 2.
   When the two trees are fully resolved bifurcating trees, their
   symmetric distance must be an even number; it can range from 0 to
   twice the number of internal branches, which for n species is 4n-6.

   Note the relationship between the two distances. If all trees have all
   their branches have length 1.0, the Branch Score Distance is the
   square of the Symmetric Difference, as each branch that is present in
   one but not in the other results in 1.0 being added to the sum of
   squared differences.

   We have assumed that nothing is lost if the trees are treated as
   unrooted trees. It is easy to define a counterpart to the Branch Score
   Distance and one to the Symmetric Difference for these rooted trees.
   Each branch then defines a set of species, namely the clade defined by
   that branch. Thus if the first of the two trees above were considered
   as a rooted tree it would define the three clades {A, C}, {B, D, E},
   and {B, E}. The Branch Score Distance is computed from the branch
   lengths for all possible sets of species, with 0 put for each set that
   does not occur on that tree. The table above will be nearly the same,
   but with two entries instead of one for the sets on either side of the
   root, {A C D} and {B E}. The Symmetric Difference between two rooted
   trees is simply the count of the number of clades that are defined by
   one but not by the other. For the second tree the clades would be {A,
   D}, {B, C, E}, and {B, E}. The Symmetric Difference between thee two
   rooted trees would then be 4.

   Although the examples we have discussed have involved fully
   bifurcating trees, the input trees can have multifurcations. This does
   not cause any complication for the Branch Score Distance. For the
   Symmetric Difference, it can lead to distances that are odd numbers.

   However, note one strong restriction. The trees should all have the
   same list of species. If you use one set of species in the first two
   trees, and another in the second two, and choose distances for
   adjacent pairs, the distances will be incorrect and will depend on the
   order of these pairs in the input tree file, in odd ways.

Input file format

   ftreedistpair reads two input tree files. The tree files may either
   have the number of trees on their first line, or not. If the number of
   trees is given, it is actually ignored and all trees in the tree file
   are considered, even if there are more trees than indicated by the
   number. There is no maximum number of trees that can be processed but,
   if you feed in too many, there may be an error message about running
   out of memory. The problem is particularly acute if you choose the
   option to examine all possible pairs of trees one from each of two
   input tree files. Thus if there are 1,000 trees in the input tree
   file, keep in mind that all possible pairs means 1,000,000 pairs to be
   examined!

   The Full matrix is only available for analyses P and L (not for A or
   C).

   Option V (Verbose) writes one distance per line. The Verbose output is
   the default. Here it is for the example data set given below:

Tree distance program, version 3.6

Symmetric differences between adjacent pairs of trees:

Trees 1 and 2:    4
Trees 3 and 4:    10
Trees 5 and 6:    4
Trees 7 and 8:    4
Trees 9 and 10:    4
Trees 11 and 12:    10

   Option S (Sparse or terse) is similar except that all that is given on
   each line are the numbers of the two trees and the distance, separated
   by blanks. This may be a convenient format if you want to write a
   program to read these numbers in, and you want to spare yourself the
   effort of having the program wade through the words on each line in
   the Verbose output. The first four lines of the Sparse output are
   titles that your program would want to skip past. Here is the Sparse
   output for the example trees.

Author(s)

   This program is an EMBOSS conversion of a program written by Joe
   Felsenstein as part of his PHYLIP package.

   Although we take every care to ensure that the results of the EMBOSS
   version are identical to those from the original package, we recommend
   that you check your inputs give the same results in both versions
   before publication.

   Please report all bugs in the EMBOSS version to the EMBOSS bug team,
   not to the original author.
