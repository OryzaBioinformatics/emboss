Function

   Shows protein sequences as helices
   
Description

   pepwheel
   displays peptide sequences in a helical representation.
   
   This gives a view of a helix from a protein sequence looking down the
   axis of the helix.
   
   It is useful for highlighting amphipathicity and other properties of
   residues around a helix.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with pepwheel.

   Optional qualifiers (* if not always prompted):

   -turns              integer    The number of residues plotted per turn is
                                  the 'steps' value divided by this value.
*  -squares            string     By default the aliphatic residues ILVM are

                                  residues are unmarked. This overrides any
                                  other markup that you may have specified
                                  using the qualifiers '-squares', '-diamonds'
                                  and '-octags'.
   -data               boolean    Output the match data to a file instead of
                                  plotting it

   General qualifiers:
  -help                boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose

Notes

   The default settings for turn (5) and steps (18) apply to alpha
   helices. For other possible secondary structures, see the following
   table:

Warnings

   When you specify the number of turns and steps, be aware that you
   should remove common factors from these two numbers. For example, if
   you (for some improbable reason) wished to plot a wheel with 8 turns
   in 18 steps (2.25 residues per turn) you should remove the common
   factor (i.e. 2) and specify 4 turns in 9 steps.
