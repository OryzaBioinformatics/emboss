                                Program geecee
                                       
Function

   Calculates the fractional GC content of nucleic acid sequences
   
Description

   This calculates the fraction of G+C bases of the input nucleic acid
   sequence(s).
   
   It reads in nucleic acid sequences, sums the number of 'G' and 'C'
   bases and writes out the result as the fraction (in the interval 0.0
   to 1.0) of the length of the whole sequence.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with geecee.

% geecee embl:hhtetra
Output file [hhtetra.geecee]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
  [-outfile]           outfile    Output file name

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 2) Output file name Output file <sequence>.geecee

Output file format

   Here is the output from the example usage:

#Sequence   GC content
HHTETRA       0.53

   The first non-blank line is the title line. Subsequent lines consist
   of two columns of data.
     * The first column is the name of the sequence.
     * The second column is the percentage G+C content of the sequence.
