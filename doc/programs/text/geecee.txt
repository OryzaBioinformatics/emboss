Function

   Calculates the fractional GC content of nucleic acid sequences
   
Description

   This calculates the percentage G+C of the input nucleic acid
   sequence(s).
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with geecee.

% geecee embl:hhtetra
Output file [hhtetra.geecee]:

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequence]          seqall     Sequence database USA
  [-outfile]           outfile    Output file name

   Optional qualifiers: (none)
   Advanced qualifiers: (none)

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequence]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence database USA Readable sequence(s) Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 2) Output file name Output file <sequence>.geecee
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

   Any DNA sequence USA.
   
Output file format

   Here is the output from the example usage:

#Sequence   GC content
HHTETRA       0.53

   The first non-blank line is the title line. Subsequent lines consist
   of two columns of data.
     * The first column is the name of the sequence.
     * The second column is the percentage G+C content of the sequence.
