                               Program einverted
                                       
Function

   Finds DNA inverted repeats
   
Description

   einverted looks for inverted repeats (stem loops) in a nucleotide
   sequence.
   
   It will find inverted repeats that include a proprtion of mismatches
   and gaps (bulges in the stem loop).
   
   It works by finding alignments between the sequence and its reverse
   complement that exceed a threshold score. Gaps and Mismatches are
   assigned a penalty (negative) score. Matches are assigned a positive
   score. The score is calculated by summing the values of each match,
   the penalties of each mismatch and the large penalties of any gaps.
   Any region whose score exceeds the threshold is reported.
   
   einverted uses dynamic programming and thus is guaranteed to find the
   optimal alignment, but is slower than, for example, a self-by-self
   BLAST. It can find multiple inverted repeats in a sequence.
   
   Currently the maximal extent of the interval from start to end of the
   repeat is set to 4000 bp.
   
   Secondary structures like inverted repeats in genomic sequences may be
   implicated in initiation of DNA replication.

Notes

   Sometimes you can find repeats using the program palindrome that you
   can't find with einverted using the default parameters.
   
   This is not due to a problem with either program. It is simply because
   some of the shortest repeats that you find with palindrome's default
   parameter values are below einverted's default cutoff score - you
   should decrease the 'Minimum score threshold' to see them.
   
   For example, when palindrome is run with 'em:hsfau1', it finds the
   repeat:
   
64    aaaactaaggc    74
      |||||||||||
98    ttttgattccg    88

   einverted will not report this as its score is 33 (11 bases scoring 3
   each, no mismatches or gaps) with is below the default score cutoff of
   50.
   
   If einverted is run as:
   
   % einverted em:hsfau1 -threshold 33
   
   then it will find it:
   
Score 33: 11/11 (100%) matches, 0 gaps
      64 aaaactaaggc 74
         |||||||||||
      98 ttttgattccg 88

   (Anything can be considered to be a repeat if you set the score
   threshold low enough!)
