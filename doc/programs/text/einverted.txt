Function

   Finds DNA inverted repeats
   
Description

   This looks for inverted repeats (stem loops) in a nucleotide sequence.
   
   It will find inverted repeats that include a proprtion of mismatches
   and gaps (bulges in the stem loop).
   
   It works by finding alignments between the sequence and its reverse
   complement that exceed a threshold score. The score is calculated by
   summing the values of each match, the penalties of each mismatch and
   the large penalties of any gaps.
   
   Secondary structures like inverted repeats in genomic sequences may be
   implicated in initiation of DNA replication.
