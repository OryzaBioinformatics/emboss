                               Program isochore
                                       
Function

   Plots isochores in large DNA sequences
   
Description

   The nuclear genomes of vertebrates are mosaics of isochores, very long
   stretches (>300kb) of DNA that are homogeneous in base composition and
   are compositionally correlated with the coding sequences that they
   embed. Isochores can be partitioned in a small number of families that
   cover a range of GC levels (GC is the molar ratio of guanine+cytosine
   in DNA), which is narrow in cold-blooded vertebrates, but broad in
   warm-blooded vertebrates.
   
   This application plots GC content over a sequence. It is intended for
   large sequences such as complete chromosomes or large genomic contigs,
   although interesting results can also be obtained from shorter
   sequences.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with isochore. This reads yeast chromosome 3
   from a remote web server so the sequence reading may take a little
   time.
