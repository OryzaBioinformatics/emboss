Function

   Get ontology term(s) by id with common parent

Description

   ontogetsibs finds ontology terms matching a query. All siblings of the
   term (i.e. sharingh the same parent by 'is_a' (class/subclass)
   relationships, are returned. The information may be written to an
   output file in various formats.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with ontogetsibs


% ontogetsibs edam:0000575
Get ontology term(s) by id with common parent

Input file format

   The input is a standard EMBOSS ontology query.

   The major ontology sources defined as standard in EMBOSS installations
   are EDAM, GO (gene Ontology) and SO (Sequence Ontology).

   Data can also be read from ontology output in "obo" format written by
   an EMBOSS application.

  Input files for usage example

  Database entry: edam:0000575

[Term]
id: EDAM:0000575
name: Restriction map rendering
namespace: operation
def: Visualise restriction maps in DNA sequences.
subset: operation
is_a: EDAM:0000573 ! DNA map rendering
is_a: EDAM:0000431 ! Restriction site recognition
relationship: has_output EDAM:0001289 ! Restriction map


Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS ontology term file.

   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -oformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. The available format names are: obo,
   brief, list, html, xml, json, excel.

   See: http://emboss.sf.net/docs/themes/OntologyFormats.html for further
   information on ontology formats.
