Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-sequencea]         sequence   Sequence USA
  [-sequenceb]         sequence   Sequence USA
  [-outfile]           align      Output alignment file name

   Optional qualifiers:
   -datafile           matrix     This is the scoring matrix file used when
                                  comparing sequences. By default it is the
                                  file 'EBLOSUM62' (for proteins) or the file
                                  'EDNAFULL' (for nucleic sequences). These
                                  files are found in the 'data' directory of
                                  the EMBOSS installation.
   -gappenalty         integer    Gap penalty
   -gaplength          integer    Gap length penalty

   Advanced qualifiers: (none)
   General qualifiers:
  -help                boolean    Report command line options. More
                                  information on associated and general
                                  qualifiers can be found with -help -verbose
   

   Mandatory qualifiers Allowed values Default
   [-sequencea]
   (Parameter 1) Sequence USA Readable sequence Required
   [-sequenceb]
   (Parameter 2) Sequence USA Readable sequence Required
   [-outfile]
   (Parameter 3) Output alignment file name Alignment file
   Optional qualifiers Allowed values Default
   -datafile This is the scoring matrix file used when comparing
   sequences. By default it is the file 'EBLOSUM62' (for proteins) or the
   file 'EDNAFULL' (for nucleic sequences). These files are found in the
   'data' directory of the EMBOSS installation. Comparison matrix file in
   EMBOSS data path EBLOSUM62 for protein
   EDNAFULL for DNA
   -gappenalty Gap penalty Positive integer 12 for protein, 16 for
   nucleic
   -gaplength Gap length penalty Positive integer 2 for protein, 4 for
   nucleic
   Advanced qualifiers Allowed values Default
   (none)
   
Input file format

   Any 2 sequence USAs of the same type (DNA or protein).
   
Output file format

   The output is a standard EMBOSS alignment file.
   
   The results can be output in one of several styles by using the
   command-line qualifier -aformat xxx, where 'xxx' is replaced by the
   name of the required format. Some of the alignment formats can cope
   with an unlimited number of sequences, while others are only for pairs
   of sequences.
   
   The available multiple alignment format names are: unknown, multiple,
   simple, fasta, msf, trace, srs
   
   The available pairwise alignment format names are: pair, markx0,
   markx1, markx2, markx3, markx10, srspair, score
   
   See: http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Themes/AlignFormats.html
   for further information on alignment formats.
   
   The output from the example follows:

Data files

   For protein sequences EBLOSUM62 is used for the substitution matrix.
   For nucleotide sequence, EDNAMAT is used. Others can be specified.
   
   EMBOSS data files are distributed with the application and stored in
   the standard EMBOSS data directory, which is defined by EMBOSS
   environment variable EMBOSS_DATA.
   
   Users can provide their own data files in their own directories.
   Project specific files can be put in the current directory, or for
   tidier directory listings in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   Files for all EMBOSS runs can be put in the user's home directory, or
   again in a subdirectory called ".embossdata".
   
   The directories are searched in the following order:
     * . (your current directory)
     * .embossdata (under your current directory)
     * ~/ (your home directory)
     * ~/.embossdata
