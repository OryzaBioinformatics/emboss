Function

   Displays a program's help documentation manual
   
Description

   This program displays the help documentation for an EMBOSS program.
   
   The contributors of the EMBOSS programs do attempt to provide an
   adequate description of the programs. This documentation is primarily
   held as HTML pages at http://www.uk.embnet.org/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/
   
   The documentation is also available however through the program tfm as
   normal text.
   
   tfm is unusual for an EMBOSS program in that it expects to be used
   interactively and so it displays the documentation text a page at a
   time, pausing after every page for the user to proess the SPACE bar on
   their keyboard. (i.e. it uses the UNIX program more to display the
   information). This behaviour can be turned off by using the qualifier
   -nomore.
   
   If you have problems understanding the function or usage of an EMBOSS
   program, then you should contact the EMBOSS mailing list
   (emboss@embnet.org).
   
   The unusual name of this program comes from the common computing
   science expression: RTFM. This acronym, as you probably already know,
   stands for Read The Fine* Manual; so this is The Fine* Manual.
   
   * Insert the expletive of your choice here!

Function

   Finds programs by keywords in their one-line documentation

Description

   This allows a user to search for keywords or parts of words in the
   brief documentation (as displayed by a program when it first starts).
   The program name and the brief description is output. If no words to
   search for are specified, then details of all the EMBOSS programs are
   output.

   The program has been written on the assumption that most people will
   use it to quickly find the name of a program based on that program's
   description, so the output goes to the screen by default.

   This program may find some use in automatically generating lists of
   EMBOSS programs and their groups for Web pages.

Usage

   Here is a sample session with wossname

   Search for programs with 'restrict' in their description:


% wossname restrict

                                  all programs will be listed.

   Optional qualifiers (* if not always prompted):
   -explode            boolean    The groups that EMBOSS applications belong

                                  formed from definitions of the group names
                                  that start like NAME1:NAME2 and which are
                                  then expanded into many combinations of the

Input file format

   wossname reads the brief descriptions and the program groups from the
   ACD files. (ACD files control the parameters that the programs expect
   - don't worry about them unless you are writing EMBOSS programs).

   The format of ACD files is documented elsewhere.

Output file format

   The results are written out as a simple list preceded by the group
   that the programs belong to or the word that is being searched for.

UTILS MISC

   Program name Description
   embossdata Finds or fetches the data files read in by the EMBOSS
   programs
   embossversion Writes the current EMBOSS version number

   If the -html, -prelink and -postlink qualifiers are specified, then
   the output will be wrapped in HTML tags, ready for inclusion in a Web
   page. Note that tags such as

   , , and are not output by this program as the list of programs is
   expected to form only part of the contents of a web page - the rest of
   the web page must be supplied by the user. Data files As noted above,
   the program ACD files are searched. The average user will not need to
   worry about this. Notes If a program's ACD file does not assign the
   program to a group, it will be automatically assigned to the group
   'ASSORTED'. A program can belong to more than one group. The name of
   this program comes from its use as a favorite word of the author Terry
   Pratchett. It is used especially by the characters of the parrot in
   Eric and the dog Gaspode in Moving Pictures and Men at Arms.

Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-program]           string     Enter the name of an EMBOSS program

   Optional qualifiers:
   -outfile            outfile    If you enter the name of a file here then
                                  this program will write the program names
                                  and brief descriptions into that file.
   -html               boolean    This will format the output for displaying
                                  as a WWW document.
   -more               boolean    This uses the standard UNIX utility 'more'
                                  to display the text page-by-page, waiting
                                  for you to read one screen-full before going
                                  on to the next page. When you have finished
