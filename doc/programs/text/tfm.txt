                                  Program tfm
                                       
Function

   Displays a program's help documentation manual
   
Description

   This program displays the help documentation for an EMBOSS program.
   
   The contributors of the EMBOSS programs do attempt to provide an
   adequate description of the programs. This documentation is primarily
   held as HTML pages at http://www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS/Apps/
   
   The documentation is also available however through the program tfm as
   normal text.
   
   tfm is unusual for an EMBOSS program in that it expects to be used
   interactively and so it displays the documentation text a page at a
   time, pausing after every page for the user to proess the SPACE bar on
   their keyboard. (i.e. it uses the UNIX program more to display the
   information). This behaviour can be turned off by using the qualifier
   -nomore.
   
   If you have problems understanding the function or usage of an EMBOSS
   program, then you should contact the EMBOSS mailing list
   (emboss@embnet.org).
   
   The unusual name of this program comes from the common computing
   science expression: RTFM. This acronym, as you probably already know,
   stands for Read The Fine* Manual; so this is The Fine* Manual.
   
   * Insert the expletive of your choice here!
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with tfm:

% tfm wossname

   You will see a page of documentation on the wossname program. To see
   further pages, you should press the SPACE bar on your keyboard. To
   stop seeing the documentation before you get to the end of the text,
   you can press the key q to quit.
   
Command line arguments

   Mandatory qualifiers:
  [-program]           string     Enter the name of an EMBOSS program

   Optional qualifiers:
   -outfile            outfile    If you enter the name of a file here then
                                  this program will write the program names
                                  and brief descriptions into that file.
   -html               bool       This will format the output for displaying
                                  as a WWW document.
   -more               bool       This uses the standard UNIX utility 'more'
                                  to display the text page-by-page, waiting
                                  for you to read one screen-full before going
                                  on to the next page. When you have finished
                                  reading a page, press the SPACE bar to
                                  proceed to the next page.
