Function

   Strips out DNA between a pair of vector sequences
   
Description

   vectorstrip is intended to be useful for stripping vector sequence
   from the ends of sequences of interest. For example, if a fragment has
   been cloned into a vector and then sequenced, the sequence may contain
   vector data eg from the cloning polylinker at the 5' and 3' ends of
   the sequence. vectorstrip will remove these contaminating regions and
   output trimmed sequence ready for input into another application.
   
   vectorstrip is suitable for use with low quality sequence data as it
   can allow for mismatches between the sequence and the vector patterns
   provided. You can specify the maximum level of mismatch expected.
   
   Vector data can either be provided in a file or interactively. If
   presented in a file, vectorstrip will search all input sequences with
   all vectors listed in that file. The intention is that the user can
   maintain a single file for use with vectorstrip, containing all the
   linker sequences commonly used in the laboratory.
   
   The two patterns for each vector are searched separately against the
   sequence. Once the search is completed, each of the hits of the 5'
   sequence is paired with each of the hits of the 3' sequence and the
   resulting subsequences are output. For example, if the 5' sequence
   matches the sequence from (a) position 30-60, and(b)position 70-100,
   and the 3' sequence matches from 150-175, then two subsequences will
   be output: from 61-149, and from 101-149. The lower the quality of the
   sequence, the more likely multiple hits become if nonzero mismatches
   are accepted.
   
   Default behaviour is to report only the best matches between the
   vector patterns and the sequence. This means that if you specify a
   maximum mismatch level of 10%, but the vector patterns match the
   sequence with zero mismatches, the search will stop and the program
   will output only these "best" matches. If there are no perfect
   matches, the program will try searching again allowing 1 mismatch,
   then 2, and so on until either the patterns match the sequence or the
   maximum specified mismatch level is exceeded. You can tell vectorstrip
   to show all possible matches up to your specified maximum level, as
   illustrated in the examples below.
   
Usage

   Here are several examples of running vectorstrip. The vectorfile and
   the sequence files used in these example are given below. In each
   case, the same fragment has been cloned into the XhoI site of the
   polylinker of each vector. The cloned fragment is represented in lower
   case and the vector sequence in upper case so the sequence trimming
   can be readily seen.

Input file format

   Each line should contain the name of the vector, the 5' pattern and
   the 3' pattern.
   Lines beginning with # are treated as comments and ignored.
   If only one vector sequence is given in the it will be assumed that
   this is the 5' pattern.
   If a vector name is given but no pattern data, the vector will not be
   used.
   
   For example, the file used in the examples above is:

   Two types of output file are produced:

    2. Results summary file eg

Diagnostic Error Messages

    1.
No suitable vectors found - exiting
       indicates that the 5' and 3' patterns for the vectors were blank -
       usually this is as a result of an empty vectorfile.
    2.
Illegal pattern
       indicates that one of the vector patterns could not be compiled
       and therefore cannot be searched.
    3.
5' and 3' sequence matches are identical; inconclusive
       indicates that the 5' and 3' patterns provided were identical, and
       that they only match the sequence once. Thus the program cannot
       determine which part of the sequence is vector and which is
       insert.
       
Exit status

   It always exits with status 0.
   
Known bugs

   None.
