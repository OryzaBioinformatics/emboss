                              Program palindrome
                                       
Function

   Looks for inverted repeats in a nucleotide sequence
   
Description

   This looks for inverted repeats (stem loops) in a nucleotide sequence.
   
   It will find inverted repeats that include a proportion of mismatches
   and gaps (bulges in the stem loop).
   
   It works by finding all possible inverted matches satisfying the
   specified conditions of minimum and maximum length of palindrome,
   maximum gap between repeated regions and number of mismatches allowed.
   
   Secondary structures like inverted repeats in genomic sequences may be
   implicated in initiation of DNA replication.
   
Usage

   Here is a sample session with palindrome. As there are a number of
   overlapping possibilties in this sequence, we choose a longer minimum
   repeat length.

% palindrome
Input sequence: embl:hsts1
Enter minimum length of palindrome [10]: 15
Enter maximum length of palindrome [100]:
Enter maximum gap between repeated regions [100]:
Number of mismatches allowed [0]:
Output file [hsts1.pal]:
Report overlapping matches [Y]:

Notes

   Unless the qualifier '-nooverlap' is specified, palindrome makes no
   attempt to exclude subsets of previously found palindromes.
   
   Several examples can be seen in the sample output above.
