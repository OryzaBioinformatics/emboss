<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

<p>The EMBOSS package
consists of a large number of separate programs that have a specific function.
They usually take a (number of) input file(s) and some parameters that are
important to the function and produce output in the form of files, plots, web
pages or simple text output.</p>

<p>The programs can be invoked in a
myriad of ways. Its name could be entered on the command line with all
parameters, so the program will have all the information it needs all at once.
A more interactive way is a query-answer session with the user, in which the
user is asked to enter a piece of information one at a time. A third way could
be a web-interface where a user chooses the options for the program using
lists, checkboxes, radio buttons etc. In EMBOSS, the way a program interacts
with the user, its interface, is independent of the actual program.</p>

<a name="sect11">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>1.1 Command line syntax</h2>

<p>At the moment, EMBOSS
programs are called by giving their name on the UNIX command line either with
or without parameters. Many parameters can have qualifiers that will give more
information about a parameter. For instance, the format of the information in a
sequence file that is used as an input file could be specified on the command
line, like:</p>

<table border=0 cellpadding=0>
 <tr>
  <td>
  <p>% <b>seqret</b> <i>filename.seq</i>
  -sformat <i>fasta</i></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>In this example the EMBOSS program ' <b>seqret</b> is called with
the filename '<i>filename.seq</i>' as its first parameter.  '-sformat
<i>fasta</i>' indicates that the sequence file is in 'fasta' format.
A complete description of the command line syntax will follow in <a
href="#sect2">section 2 Formal Description of the ACD language.</a>
The percentage sign '%' indicates that the command was entered on the
UNIX command line. This will be used throughout the documentation.</p>

<a name="sect12">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>1.2 ACD files</h2>

<p>Every EMBOSS program will be accompanied by a so-called ACD (Ajax
Command Definitions) file, which describes the parameters that the
program it refers to needs. It contains information about its input
and output files and other parameters the program may need. It will
indicate if any of the parameters are mandatory (like an input
sequence file) or that certain parameters are within certain limits (a
gap penalty for an alignment must be higher then 0 for instance). It
can also indicate whether one parameter's value is dependent on the
value or the presence of another. (An example: If the input sequence
for an alignment program is DNA, it should not accept a protein
comparison matrix).</p>

<a name="sect13">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>1.3 ACD language</h2>

<p>The parameters are
defined in a special purpose language called Ajax Command Definitions or ACD,
specially designed for EMBOSS. It will specify everything that can appear on
the command line or can be used in another interface like web pages. It is a
very 'forgiving' language in that it does not restrict the available syntax any
more than is strictly necessary.</p>

<a name="sect2">&nbsp;</a>
<h1>2. Formal description of the ACD language</h1>

<a name="sect21">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>2.1 ACD file overview</h2>

<p>ACD files are simple
text files that contain the definitions. The files usually have the same prefix
as the program, but this is not required. ACD files use the extension '.acd'.
This is mandatory.</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>Comments start with "#" and continue to the end of the
     line. </li>
 <li>Each line is parsed into tokens delimited by <b>spaces</b>. </li>
 <li>All values are regarded as strings until finally resolved. </li>
 <li>There is only one pass through when parsing, so all variables in
     dependencies have to be declared before the line where they are used.</li>
 <li>Parameters and qualifiers are defined by a single token followed by
     a colon ':' and white space, which in turn is
     followed by a second token. The definition of the parameter or qualifier
     is delimited by a pair of square brackets '[ ]', which can span multiple
     lines.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<pre>
token: token [
   <i>definition</i>
]
</pre>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<pre>
token=token [
    <i>definition</i>
]
</pre>

<p>The first token in the file must be "application" directly followed
by a colon ':' or an equal sign '='. The second token is the
application name with which this ACD file is associated. The
application name is followed by (required) application attributes
enclosed in square brackets. </p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<pre>
  application: appname [
     <i>attributes</i>
  ]
</pre>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre>
application: wossname [
    documentation: "Finds programs by keywords"
    groups: "Display"
  ]
</pre>

<p>The first token of a parameter definition is an Ajax datatype,
directly followed by a colon ':' (preferred) or equal sign '='. The
second token is the name by which this parameter is going to be known
(this is also the name that is used by the EMBOSS program to get the
value of the parameter). After the name, definitions are in
<b>mandatory</b> square brackets, [], which can make a definition span
multiple lines.</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<pre>
datatype: parametername [
    <i>definition</i>
  ]
</pre>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre>
sequence: asequence [
    standard: "Y"
  ]
</pre>

<p>Tokens representing data types can be abbreviated up to the point
where they are not ambiguous. For example, <i>default:</i> can be
abbreviated to <i>default:</i> or even <i>d:</i> although the latter is
not recommended due to lack of clarity.</p>
<p>Values can be delimited (i.e. treated as one token) by double quotes</p>

<a name="sect22">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>2.2 The application definition</h2>

<p>The first token of an ACD file must be the <i>application:</i> token,
followed by the application name. The application name and the ACD
filename (without the <i>.acd</i> extension) are usually identical,
but this is not mandatory. When a program calls the
<i>embInit("program")</i> function with <i>"program"</i> as its
parameter, the function will only look for an ACD file called
<i>program.acd</i>. It will not compare the parameter with the string
given after the <i>application:</i> token.</p>

<a name="sect221">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>2.2.1 Application attributes</h3>


<a name="sect2211">&nbsp;</a>
<h4>2.2.1.1 The documentation attribute</h4>

<p>The <i>application:</i> token has a <i>documentation:</i> attribute which is
followed by a string describing the function of the program.  This
documentation string will be used to generate the description of the
program when the program is run or the user specifies the <i>-help</i>
qualifier. When the <i>documentation:</i> attribute is missing, a warning will
be issued.
</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<pre>
application: appname [
    documentation: string
  ]
</pre>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<p>ACD file definition (partly):</p>

<pre>
application: seqret [
    documentation: "Reads and writes (returns) a sequence"
  ]
</pre>

<p><b>Command line:</b></p>

<pre>
% <b>seqret</b>
Reads and writes (returns) a sequence
Input sequence :
</pre>

<p>The ACD file starts with the definition of the program
<b>seqret</b>. The <i>documentation:</i> attribute is followed by a
string briefly explaining the function of the program and this string
is shown after the program is invoked and before it prompts the user
for any input. The <i>documentation:</i> string is also searched by
the <b>wossname</b> utility, which finds applications by keyword (in
the <i>doc</i> string) and group.</p>

<p>The length of the <i>documentation:</i> string should be kept to 63
characters or shorter in order to allow the <b>wossname</b> utility to
display each program name and its documentation on one 80-character
line.</p>

<p>The <i>documentation:</i> string should <b>not</b> end
with a '.' character</p>

<p>Any acronyms or capitalised abbreviations in the
<i>documentation:</i> string should be written in upper case. (e.g.:
SNPs, EST, DNA, ABI, SRS, ASCII, CDS, mRNA, B-DNA, RNA, CpG, ORFs,
MAR/SAR, PCR, STS, REBASE, SCOP, PROSITE, PRINTS, EMBL, TRANSFAC,
AAINDEX, BLAST, GCG, EMBOSS)</p>

<p>The <i>documentation:</i> string should start with an
upper-case letter.</p>

<a name="sect2212">&nbsp;</a>
<h4>2.2.1.2 The groups attribute</h4>

<p>The <i>groups:</i> attribute allows the EMBOSS programs to be
grouped together based on their functionality. The <i>groups:</i>
attribute is followed by a string value, containing the name(s) of the
group(s). When an application belongs to more then one group, the
group names must be separated by either a comma (,) or semi-colon (;);
i.e. a group name is not a token, but a list of tokens.</p>

<p>The <i>groups:</i> string is also searched by the <b>wossname</b>
utility, which finds applications by keyword (in the <i>doc</i>
string) and group.</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<pre>
application: appname [
    groups: "group name1, group2, ... "
  ]
</pre>

<p><b>Example:</b> ACD file definition (partly):</p>

<pre>
application: seqret [
    groups: "Display"
  ]
</pre>

<a name="sect2213">&nbsp;</a>
<h4>2.2.1.3 Groups format</h4>

<p>Group names can have spaces in them.</p>

<p>The group names can be split into sub-levels by
the use of a ':' character: <br>
<b>First Level : Second Level</b> <br>
Several third-party interfaces are starting to rely upon there being a maximum
of 2 levels, so do not use more than one ':' in a group name.</p>

<p>The group name is now checked against a list of
accepted values in the file <b>groups.standard</b> which is defined
and installed in the same directory as the ACD files. This file
contains one line for each known group, with subgroups defined with a
":" delimiter, and spaces replaced by underscores. Each group also
has a short description.</p>

<p>The table in the following section lists all groups currently
defined</p>

<a name="sect2214">&nbsp;</a>
<h4>2.2.1.4 The groups structure</h4>

<p>The First and Second level group names are
given below with some explanation of what might be expected to be placed in the
group.</p>

<p>If a group is composed of two levels, such as <br>
<b>Alignment : Consensus</b> <br>
then the group specification must not use the group names singly, (i.e. you
must not use <b>"Alignment"</b> or <b>"Consensus"</b>). <br>
If the group consists of only one level, such as <br>
<b>Display</b> <br> then please don't start adding sub-levels to
it. (i.e. you must not use <b>"Display : Features"</b>)</p>

<p>You are <b>strongly</b> encouraged to use the
following groups structure. This is the set of groups defined by the
<b>groups.standard</b> file. We have found that most things will fit in one or
more of these groups. When, however, a completely new category of program is
written, please discuss the creation of the new group name with the developers'
mailing list. Sometimes a new group is required (for example the group "Enzyme
Kinetics" which had to be created to hold 'findkm').</p>

<h2>2.3 Ajax Data Types</h2>

<p>ACD files describe the parameters that a
program needs, in an object-oriented manner. The most important types or
objects are file objects, sequence objects, number objects, Boolean objects and
string objects. The current objects are listed in Table 1.</p>



<!-- #tabletypes -->

<a name="sect231">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>2.3.1 Description of the data types</h3>

<a name="sect2311">&nbsp;</a>
<!-- #acdtype-section-simple -->
<h4>2.3.1.1 Simple</h4>

<!-- #acdtype-array -->
<h5>Array</h5>

<p>Array parameters are lists of numbers, either
integer or floating point. The ACD attributes control validation, for example
the number of values, or a list of numbers that adds to a given total. The data
value is a list of numbers separated by spaces or commas.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-boolean -->
<h5>Boolean</h5>

<p>Boolean parameters are simple switches. If they
are entered on the command line the value will be Y (True), if they are absent
from the command line the value will be the default value. The name can also be
prefixed by 'no' to force the value to be N (False). This is needed if the
default value is Y (True). The data value is Y for yes and N for no.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-integer -->
<h5>Integer</h5>

<p>The integer data type can hold simple integer
values. The value range can be controlled by minimum and maximum values (a
minimum value of 0 or 1 is often useful).</p>

<!-- #acdtype-float -->
<h5>Float</h5>

<p>Simple float values. The value range can be
controlled by minimum and maximum ACD attributes (a minimum value of 0.0 is
often useful).</p>

<!-- #acdtype-range -->
<h5>Range</h5>

<p>Ranges of sequence positions. Originally
defined as a simple list of paired numbers, ranges can now be specified in
files with the range syntax <i>"@filename"</i>, as pairs of numbers
with text comments. For example:</p>

<pre>
# this is my set of ranges
 12      23
  4      5       this is like 12-23, but smaller
 67      10348   interesting region
</pre>

<!-- #acdtype-string -->
<h5>String</h5>

<p>Any string value. The length can be controlled by ACD attributes,
and a regular expression pattern to provide more general validation if
necessary. Most string values are free text, although strings can be
used by a program for any input that is not covered by a defined ACD
type.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-toggle -->
<h5>Toggle</h5>

<p>Toggle parameters are simple switches, and work in the same way as
"boolean" parameters. Toggle parameters are intended for use in
turning on/off other parameters. When ACD parameters are grouped in
sections, a clean ACD file will  have all the "required" parameters in
the "required" secion and all the "additional" parameters in the
"additional" section. Some of these will have calculated values for
the "standard" and "additional" attributes, controlled by the value of
another parameter. The "toggle" parameters are designed to be used in
these calculated values, and can be in the "required" section even if
not themselves defined as "standard".</p>

<p>Exactly like "boolean" parameters, if they
are entered on the command line the value will be Y (True), if they are absent
from the command line the value will be the default value. The name can also be
prefixed by 'no' to force the value to be N (False). This is needed if the
default value is Y (True). The data value is Y for yes and N for
no.</p>

<a name="fnB1">&nbsp;</a>
<!-- #acdtype-section-input -->
<h4>2.3.1.2 Input<a href="#fn1">[1]</a></h4>

<!-- #acdtype-codon -->
<h5>Codon</h5>

<p>Codon usage tables are simple files read from the EMBOSS data
search path, and are distributed in the emboss/data directory.</p>

<p>Codon usage files can be read in several formats, including "gcg".</p>

<!-- #acdtype-cpdb -->
<h5>Cpdb</h5>

<p>Cpdb (Cleaned PDB) files are simple input files
in CPDB format. See the documentation for pdbparse, part of the
EMBASSY domainatrix package, which generates
CPDB files from PDB file input.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-datafile -->
<h5>Datafile</h5>

<p>Datafile input refers to a formatted data file to be read from the
standard
EMBOSS data file locations (see the EMBOSS Administrator's guide for
full details).</p>

<p>EMBOSS looks for data files in the local/share/EMBOSS/data
directory, or in various user directories.
</p>

<p>Most data files are already defined as their own ACD types -
matrix, matrixf, codon. Otehrs are hard coded file names that do not
need their own ACD definition, although users are free to define their
own file with the appropriate name to override the default file provided.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-directory -->
<h5>Directory</h5>

<p>Directory defines a directory that can be used for input or output
definitions.</p>

<p>Directory is intended for future use to replace string definitions
of directory names in some applications, and to provide additional
validation of the user input specific to directory specifications.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-dirlist -->
<h5>Dirlist</h5>

<p>Directory defines a set (list) of directories that can be used for
input or output definitions.</p>

<p>Dirlist is intended for future use to replace string definitions
of directory names in some applications, and to provide additional
validation of the user input specific to directory specifications.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-discretestates -->
<h5>Discretestates</h5>

<p>Discretestates is a new ACD type implemented specifically for
the "phylipnew" EMBASSY package. Discretestates input is used by the
phylip "discrete character" applications. By defining a specific ACD
type EMBOSS can provide detailed type checking, and can automatically
detect and validate the various alternative formats that phylip supports
without the need for complex extra command line options.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-distances -->
<h5>Distances</h5>

<p>Distances is a new ACD type implemented specifically for
the "phylipnew" EMBASSY package. Discretestates input is used by the
phylip "distance matrix" applications. By defining a specific ACD
type EMBOSS can provide detailed type checking, and can automatically
detect and validate the various alternative formats that phylip supports
without the need for complex extra command line options.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-features -->
<h5>Features</h5>

<p>Feature annotation in any known feature format.
Features can also be read from a sequence and written with a sequence.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-filelist -->
<h5>Filelist</h5>

<p>Filelist defines a set (list) of input files.</p>

<p>Filelist is intended for future use to replace string definitions
of input file names in some applications, and to provide additional
validation of the user input specific to multiple input files.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-frequencies -->
<h5>Frequencies</h5>

<p>Frequencies is a new ACD type implemented specifically for the
"phylipnew" EMBASSY package. Discretestates input is used by the
phylip "gene frequency and continuous character" applications. By
defining a specific ACD type EMBOSS can provide detailed type
checking, and can automatically detect and validate the various
alternative formats that phylip supports without the need for complex extra
command line options.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-infile -->
<h5>Infile</h5>

<p>Non-sequence-related data file. This data type
refers to files that are to be used in the program and do usually not contain
sequence data. The type of data can be identified by a "knowntype"
attribute and matched to Outfile standard types, or to report, align, featout,
or seqout formats.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-matrix -->
<h5>Matrix</h5>

<p>Comparison matrix files are used by many
programs. They are data files read from the EMBOSS data search path, and are
distributed in the emboss/data directory. For preference, we use the matrix
files distributed with BLAST.</p>

<p>Integer matrices are usually faster and are
preferred by most applications. Floating-point matrix files are also available
if needed, and an integer matrix file can of course also be read as floating
point.</p>

<p>The matrix data type has an attribute to force
selection of a nucleic acid or protein comparison matrix. In ACD files, the
type of the input sequence is often used here.</p>

<p>Remember that any application which uses gap
penalties will need to set them separately for each matrix.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-matrixf -->
<h5>Matrixf</h5>

<p>Floating point comparison matrices are required by some
algorithms. An integer matrix file can of course be used equally well
as a floating point matrix.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-pattern -->
<h5>Pattern</h5>

<p>Pattern definitions files allow multiple search patterns to be
described, each with a name.</p>

<p>Pattern files are used for PROSITE syntax sequence patterns. The
same syntax is used for "regexp" input. Pattern files also allow
mismatch values to be defined for each pattern, and a "-pmismatch"
qualifier sets the mismatch default for all patterns in the
file. Mismatches are not appropriate for regular expression matches.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-properties -->
<h5>Properties</h5>

<p>Properties is a new ACD type implemented specifically for the
"phylipnew" EMBASSY package. Properties input is used by the phylip
applications to define weights, ancestral states and factors
(multi-state characters). By defining a specific ACD type EMBOSS can
provide detailed type checking, and can automatically detect and
validate the various alternative formats that phylip supports without
the need for complex extra command line options.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-regexp -->
<h5>Regexp</h5>

<p>Any regular expression value, or (new in release 4.0.0) a file
containing regular expressions and names.</p>

<p>The length can be vallidated and controlled
by ACD attributes. The case can be set to upper or lower case only.
The regular expression must be supported by the EMBOSS regular
expression library.</p>

<p>EMBOSS uses the "Perl-Compatible Regular Expression Library"
(PCRE), so any regular expression that is valid in Perl 5.0 should be
valid here.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-scop -->
<h5>Scop</h5>

<p>SCOP files are simple input files in SCOP
format.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-sequence -->
<h5>Sequence</h5>

<p>USA (database reference or file) indicating a single sequence. The
type of sequence can be restricted by specific attribute <i>"type"</i>
(for example, the program should only accept DNA files). Can also read
features if the "features" ACD attribute is set.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-seqall -->
<h5>Seqall</h5>

<p>set of single sequences that can be addressed
one after another (for example a set of sequences that will be used in an
multiple alignment). The type of sequence can be restricted by specific
attribute <i>"type"</i> (for example, the program should only accept
DNA files). Can also read features if the "features" ACD attribute is
set.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-seqset -->
<h5>Seqset</h5>

<p>set of single sequences that can be used all at the same time (for
example a database of some sort that is to be used for a pattern
search). The type of sequence can be restricted by specific attribute
<i>"type"</i> (for example, the program should only accept DNA
files). Can also read features if the "features" ACD attribute is
set.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-seqsetall -->
<h5>Seqsetall</h5>

<p>One or more sets of single sequences that can be used all at the
same time (for example a database of some sort that is to be used for
a pattern search). The type of sequence can be restricted by specific
attribute <i>"type"</i> (for example, the program should only accept DNA
files). Can also read features if the "features" ACD attribute is
set.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-tree -->
<h5>Tree</h5>

<p>Tree is a new ACD type implemented specifically for the "phylipnew"
EMBASSY package. Properties input is used by the phylip applications
to define one or more phylogenetic trees. By defining a specific ACD
type EMBOSS can provide detailed type checking, and can automatically
detect and validate the various alternative formats that phylip
supports without the need for complex extra command line options. The
trees are currently parsed by phylip itself, but in the near future we
will implement parsing methods in ACD processing.</p>

<a name="sect2313">&nbsp;</a>
<!-- #acdtype-section-selection -->
<h4>2.3.1.3 Selection lists</h4>

<p>Selection lists are a way to present the user with
a limited list of options he/she can choose from. For the user, the difference
between the <i>list</i> and <i>selection</i> data type is minimal and lies only in
the way the choices are labelled. In a <i>selection</i> data type, the choices are
numbered automatically from 1 up. In a <i>list</i> data type the choices can be
labelled by any arbitrary text label. The user can choose one of the options by
either typing the number (for a <i>selection</i> type) or the text of the label
(for a <i>list</i> type) or a non-ambiguous part of the value of the choice. In
practice, the <i>list</i> data type is much preferred for this reason.</p>



<!-- #acdtype-list -->
<h5>List</h5>

<p>A list of text descriptions with short labels.
The user can enter one (or sometimes more) labels, or can specify partial text
descriptions. The program is given a list of text labels as input.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-selection -->
<h5>Selection</h5>

<p>A list of text descriptions (usually short,
unlike list data), with generated numbers. The user can enter one (or sometimes
more) numbers, or can specify partial text descriptions. The program is given a
list of text descriptions as input. The <i>list</i>data
type is usually preferred.</p>



<ul type=disc>
 <li>List </li>
 <li>Selection</li>
</ul>

<a name="sect2314">&nbsp;</a>
<!-- #acdtype-section-output -->
<h4>2.3.1.4 Output <a href="#fn1">[1]</a></h4>

<!-- #acdtype-align -->
<h5>Align</h5>

<p>An output file for sequence alignments. Defined
in the same way as a plain text "Outfile" but with extra qualifiers
to allow a choice of alignment formats, and attributes to specify whether the
alignment will have 2 or more sequences (which limits the possible formats).
The data is stored as sequences, the available formats include the most common
sequence formats.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-featout -->
<h5>Featout</h5>

<p>Feature annotation in any known feature format.
Can also be stored with the sequence if the sequence output
"features" attribute is set.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-outcodon -->
<h5>Outcodon</h5>

<p>Output file containing codon usage data.
The default data format can be specified by an "oformat" attribute
which the <i>-oformat</i> associated qualifier can override.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-outcpdb -->
<h5>Outcpdb</h5>

<p>Output file containing cleaned PDB protein structure data.
The default data format can be specified by an "oformat" attribute
which the <i>-oformat</i> associated qualifier can override.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-outdata -->
<h5>Outdata</h5>

<p>Output file containing cleaned formatted data as tables or lists.
The default data format can be specified by an "oformat" attribute
which the <i>-oformat</i> associated qualifier can override.</p>

<p>Multiple <b>outdata</b> definitions are by default appended to a
single file. The individual ACD definitions allow the format of each
file section to be defined.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-outdir -->
<h5>Outdir</h5>

<p>Output directory for multiple output files to be written.
Specifying an <b>outdir</b> allows other properties to be defined,
including the default file extension with the "extension" attribute.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-outdiscrete -->
<h5>Outdiscrete</h5>

<p>Output file containing phylogenetics discrete characteristics data.
The default data format can be specified by an "oformat" attribute
which the <i>-oformat</i> associated qualifier can override.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-outdistance -->
<h5>Outdistance</h5>

<p>Output file containing phylogenetics distance matrix data.
The default data format can be specified by an "oformat" attribute
which the <i>-oformat</i> associated qualifier can override.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-outfile -->
<h5>Outfile</h5>

<p>Non-sequence-related data file, usually plain
text. This data type refers to files that are to be produced by the program and
usually do not contain sequence data. The type of data can be identified by a
"knowntype" attribute and matched to an Infile standard type for
use as input to another program.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-outfileall -->
<h5>Outfileall</h5>

<p>Non-sequence-related data files, usually plain
text. This data type refers to files that are to be produced by the program and 
usually do not contain sequence data. The type of data can be identified by a
"knowntype" attribute and matched to an Infile standard type for
use as input to another program.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-outfreq -->
<h5>Outfreq</h5>

The default data format can be specified by an "oformat" attribute
which the <i>-oformat</i> associated qualifier can override.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-outmatrix -->
<h5>Outmatrix</h5>

<p>Output file containing integer comparison matrix data.
The default data format can be specified by an "oformat" attribute
which the <i>-oformat</i> associated qualifier can override.</p>

<!-- #acdtype-outmatrixf -->
<h5>Outmatrixf</h5>

<p>Output file containing floating point comparison matrix data.

<h3>2.3.2 Parameter names</h3>

<p>ACD objects have mandatory names.</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<pre>
<i>datatype:</i> <i>parametername</i> [
 ]
</pre>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre>
sequence: asequence [
 ]
</pre>

<p>This defines <i>asequence</i> to be the name
of a sequence object.</p>

<p>In order to assign a value to a parameter, the
name of the parameter can be specified on the command line (in a number of
ways, see section 4) followed by a value that is appropriate for that data
type.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<p>ACD file definition (partly):</p>

<pre>
sequence: asequence [
  ]
</pre>

<p>Command line :</p>

<pre>
% <b>acddemo</b> -asequence <i>filename.seq</i>
</pre>



<p>This defines <i>filename.seq</i> to be the value of the parameter
named <i>asequence</i> for the EMBOSS program acddemo.</p>

<p>If a parameter is defined with a special
parameter attribute ( <i>parameter:"Y"</i>), using the name of the
parameter on the command line is not mandatory (see section 3.4). This is
commonly used for input data and for output filenames.</p>

<p>The name of an object is also used, in the
EMBOSS program, to refer to the value of the parameter. After the initiation
call using the EMBOSS function embInit(), the values of the parameters have
been read in and checked (see 1.4). The program must then assign the parameter
to an actual EMBOSS object, like sequence (AjPSeq), string (AjPStr) etc. The
actual function calls are beyond the scope of this document, and the reader is
referred to the AJAX documentation
(http://srs.ebi.ac.uk/srs7bin/cgi-bin/wgetz?-fun+pagelibinfo+-info+EDATA
for the SRS searchable Object documentation), but some examples can be found in
section 1.4 and 1.5.</p>

<p>The name can also be used in the definition of
other ACD parameters. The value of the parameter (or variable) is retrieved,
using the dollar sign '$' and a the name of the parameter encapsulated by a
pair of parentheses.</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<pre>
$(<i>parametername</i>)
</pre>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre>
integer: gappenalty    [
    standard: Y
    default: 10
  ]


integer: gapextpenalty [
    default: $(gappenalty)
  ]
</pre>

<p>This defines the default for parameter <i>gapextpenalty</i>
as the value of parameter <i>gappenalty</i>.</p>

<p><b>Naming conventions</b></p>

<p>Although everybody is free to use any (valid)
name for a parameter, we would like to propose a naming convention, to
streamline the development of ACD files.</p>

<h2>2.4 Attributes</h2>

<p>There are two types of attributes for parameters.  'Global'
attributes cen be defined for any ACD data type. Each data type then
has its own set of 'specific' attributes. These definitions can refer
to 'calculated' attributes generated automatically by ACD
processing. The 'global' and 'specific' ttributes are part of the
parameter definition and are placed between the square brackets.</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<pre>
<i>datatype:</i> <i>parametername</i> [ 
    <i>attribute: "value"</i>
  ]
</pre>


<a name="sect241">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>2.4.1 Attributes</h3>

<p>Attributes to parameters can specify the
default value, and the requirements for a correct value, for a parameter. It
can specify whether the parameter is mandatory and what the limits are for a
valid value. There are global attributes that apply to all data types and there
are data type-specific attributes.</p>

<a name="sect2411">&nbsp;</a>
<h4>2.4.1.1 The global attributes</h4>

<p><i>default:</i></p>

<p>Defines the default value for the parameter,
which can be dependent on the values of parameters defined
earlier.</p>

<p>Each data type has a default value, which can be valid (for example
a boolean will default to "N") or invalid (many input types
will default to an empty string).

<p><i>information:</i></p>

<p>The string giving information about the
parameter, for use on Web forms and in GUIs and also a default prompt to the
user</p>

<p>For some data types (sequence is a good example) there are standard
prompts so no value is expected, and the acdvalid utility will issue a
warning if an information attribute is found.

<p><i>parameter:</i></p>

<p>Defines a parameter on the command line which can appear without a
qualifier name. Also implies that the value is <i>required</i> and
will be prompted for if missing.</p>

<p><i>standard:</i></p>

<p>Indicates whether a parameter is mandatory and
will be prompted for if missing.</p>

<p><i>additional:</i></p>

<p>Indicates if the parameter should be queried
for when the <i>-options</i> qualifier is set on the command line.</p>

<p<i>help:</i></p>

<p>The string shown when the <i>-help</i>
qualifier is used on the command line</p>

<p>Help is usually only defined if a specific string is needed.
If help is not defined, the value of the "information" attribute,
or the default prompt, will be used.</p>

<p><i>expect:</i></p>

<p>A string used in the "Default" column
of the command line syntax table in the documentation. This table is
automatically generated from the ACD file, and in most cases there is a
reasonable value generated. Where there is no suitable value, this attribute
should be used to provide one.</p>

<p><i>valid:</i></p>

<p>A string used in the "Allowed values"
column of the command line syntax table in the documentation. This table is
automatically generated from the ACD file, and in most cases there is a
reasonable value generated. Where there is no suitable value, this attribute
should be used to provide one.</p>

<p><i>knowntype:</i></p>

<p>The <i>knowntype</i> attribute defines one of a controlled vocabulary of
known value types. Some ACD data types require a knowntype attribute.</p>

<p>These standard values are read from a file
<b>knowntypes.standard</B> which is stored and installed in the ACD
file directory. A few other values are accepted, for example
"(programname) output" for an outfile data type. These are documented
under each output type. The acdvalid utility will check all <i>knowntype</i>
values in an ACD file, and report any missing values for data types
that require a knowntype.</p>

<p><i>prompt:</i></p>

<p>The string used if the user has to be queried
for a value, though <i>information</i> can be used instead and usually only one
will be defined. <i>information</i> is preferred.</p>

<p><i>missing:</i></p>

<p>Indicates whether a qualifier can have no
value, especially when it appears on the command line (for example to override
a default value in the ACD file).</p>

<p><i>needed:</i></p>

<p>Indicates whether a parameter is expected to be
included in a GUI form. Some parameters are available on the command line, but
are not generally useful to users, or can cause confusion when presented in a
GUI form with all other options.</p>

<p><i>outputmodifier:</i></p>

<p>Indicates that this qualifier modifies the output in ways that can
break parsers, for example by changing text output into HTML. Authors
of wrappers can use this to test for qualifiers that can be hardcoded
to fix the output syntax and content. Please let the EMBOSS team know
if any other qualifiers are candidates for marking as output modifiers.

<p><i>code:</i></p>

<p>A code word (no spaces) which is searched for
in the file codes.english to give a standard prompt, for example when asking
for an alignment gap penalty. The standard default prompts are in the same
file. The code word is not case-sensitive. <i>information</i> is preferred.</p>

<p><i>comment:</i></p>

<p>A comment, provided for use by the EBI's SoapLab
project but not defined in the standard ACD files.</p>

<p><i>style:</i></p>

<p>Provided for use by the EBI's SoapLab project
but not defined in the standard ACD files.</p>

<p>Any global or specific attribute must have a second token
representing the value of the attribute. The attribute must be
followed by a colon ':' and usually the value will be enclosed in
double quotes.</p>

<p>The syntax of the global attributes is</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<pre>
help: <i>"String"</i>
information: <i>"String"</i>
default: <i>"value"</i>
additional: <i>"Y"/"N"</i>
parameter: <i>"Y"/"N"</i>
information: <i>"String"</i>
standard: <i>"Y"/"N"</i>
</pre>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre>
sequence: asequence [
    standard: "Y"
    information: "Enter filename"
  ]
</pre>


<a name="sect24111">&nbsp;</a>
<h5>2.4.1.1.1 Parameter: attribute</h5>

<p>The <i>parameter:</i> attribute is a boolean attribute, defining
the order of the parameters on the command line, if the parameter name
is not explicitly entered on the command line. If set to Y, the
parameter can be entered on the command line without using the
parameter name.</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<pre>
<i>datatype:</i> <i>parametername</i> [
    parameter: Y/N
  ]
</pre>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<p>ACD file definition (partly) :</p>

<pre>
application: acddemo [
    documentation: ""
    groups: ""
  ]

sequence: asequence [
  ]
</pre>

<p>Command line :</p>

<pre>
% <b>acddemo</b> -asequence <i>filename.seq</i>
</pre>

<p>Is equivalent to:</p>

<p>ACD file definition (partly) :</p>

<pre>
sequence: asequence [
    parameter: Y
  ]
</pre>

<p>Command line:</p>

<pre>
% <b>acddemo</b> <i>filename.seq</i>
</pre>

<p>In both examples <i>filename.seq</i> is the value of the parameter
named <i>asequence</i> for the EMBOSS program <b>acddemo</b>.
</p>

<p>The second example will also allow the command
line from the first, as parameter names are accepted as qualifiers.</p>

<p>If more then one parameter: attribute is used,
the order in which they appear in the ACD file is the same as the order in
which they appear on the command line.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b> ACD file definition (partly) :</p>

<pre>
application: acddemo [
    documentation: ""
    groups: ""
  ]

sequence: asequence [
    parameter: Y
  ]
outseq: outseq [
    parameter: Y
  ]
</pre>

<p>Command line :</p>

<pre>
% <b>acddemo</b> <i>infilename.seq</i> <i>outfilename.seq</i>
</pre>

<p>will assign the name <i>infilename.seq</i> to parameter
<i>asequence</i>, and <i>outfilename.seq</i> to parameter
<i>outseq</i>.</p>

<a name="sect24112">&nbsp;</a>
<h5>2.4.1.1.2 Standard: attribute</h5>

<p>Any program is expected to have one or more
required inputs. An ACD data type that is defined as a "parameter:"
(see section 2.4.1.1.1) is automatically counted as required. All other
required inputs should have the "standard:" attribute set.</p>

<p>When the program runs, the user will be
prompted for any "required" values that are not already on the
command line.</p>

<p>The only difference between
"parameter:" and "standard:" is that a
"parameter" can appear on the command line as the simple value with
no name, to provide simple command lines.</p>

<a name="sect24113">&nbsp;</a>
<h5>2.4.1.1.3 Additional: attribute</h5>

<p>When the additional: attribute is set, the parameter will only be
queried for, when the <i>-options</i> qualifier is set (on the command
line or when the system default is set using an environment variable
(See 3.7) or any other way). If the <i>-options</i> qualifier is not
set, the user will not be queried for this parameter, if it is omitted
in the program execution (i.e. not mentioned on the command line or
any other way).</p>

<a name="sect24114">&nbsp;</a>
<h5>2.4.1.1.4 The prompt: help: and information:
attributes</h5>

<p>The <i>information:</i> attribute defines the
text hint to the user entering a data value. The same text is intended for use
in the prompt to the user at a terminal, and as the text in an HTML form or a
GUI.</p>

<p>In rare cases where the <i>information:</i>
string is misleading, a <i>prompt:</i> string can be defined for use as a
terminal prompt. For general use, <i>information: </i>is
now preferred.</p>

<p>To provide standard prompts for common ACD
data, there are default <i>information:</i> strings for most data types. These
can be found in the file <i>codes.english</i> with the names DEFXXXX where XXXX
is the name of the ACD data type.</p>

<p>Common practice is to use the default prompt
for input and output ACD data types.</p>

<p>The <i>help:</i> attribute is shown in the help
information, when the user requests assistance using the <i>-help</i> qualifier
on the command line, or when help in other format is requested (Web page).</p>

<p>Again, there is a default help string in the
codes.english file with the name HELPXXXX where XXXX is the name of the ACD
data type.</p>

<p>The codes.english file includes some additional standard prompts
such as GAP for gap penalties. These prompts can be used with the
<i>code:</i> attribute, for example <i>code: "GAP"</i>, but GUI
developers found these hard to use, so we have replaced them with
normal <i>information:</i> attributes.</p>

<a name="sect2412">&nbsp;</a>
<h4>2.4.1 2 Data type-specific specific attributes</h4>

<p>The default set of attributes is available for
all ACD data type definitions.</p>



<p>Each ACD type has its own set of specific
attributes, summarized in Table 1 and described in more detail below.</p>

<a name="sect24121">&nbsp;</a>
<!-- #acdattr-section-simple -->
<h5>2.4.1.2.1 Simple</h5>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<!-- #section-simple -->

<!-- #acdattr-array -->
<h5>Array</h5>

<p>The value for an array is a set of floating point numbers with
white space or commas. The <i>size:</i> attribute sets the number of
elements in the array. As for the float data type, the <i>minimum:</i>
and <i>maximum:</i> attributes define the lower and upper value limits
and default to the boundaries as specified by the systems set-up. For
validation purposes, the <i>sum:</i> attribute defines the total for
all values in the array (tested unless the <i>sumtest:</i> attribute
is false), and the <i>tolerance:</i> attribute specifies how closely
the sum should match the total. Remember that most floating point
fractions cannot be represented accurately in binary form.
</p>

<!-- #acdattr-boolean -->
<h5>Boolean</h5>

<p>Although there are (currently) no specific attributes for a boolean
ACD type, care should be taken over the definition of the
<i>information:</i> and <i>help:</i> attributes. These are used to
prompt the user (interactively or via a GUI), and to provide help
text. The text provided in each case should reflect the expected
default value of the boolean option, which may be the opposite of what
the name implies. For example, if set to "Y" by default, then the
command line option would typically be "-noxxx" where "xxx" is the
qualifier. If set to "N" by default, then the default action may be
the opposite of what the information or help text implies. If the
value is calculated, the user may need some extra guidance.</p>

<p>The <i>outputmodifier:</i> attribute is set where this parameter
changes the content or syntax of the output. This is provided for the
developers of other interfaces and parsers of EMBOSS output so that
they can fix the value, or provide parsers for each alternative.


<!-- #acdattr-float -->
<h5>Float</h5>

<p>The <i>minimum:</i> and <i>maximum:</i> attributes define the lower
and upper value limits and default to the boundaries as specified by
the systems set-up.</p>

<p>The <i>increment:</i> attribute defines the steps
that this parameter is allowed to take, in case there is a need to
iterate this parameter. The <i>increment:</i> attribute can be any
valid float value.</p>

<p>The <i>precision:</i> attribute defines the maximum number of significant
decimal places that will be taken into account for this value.</p>


<!-- #acdattr-integer -->
<h5>Integer</h5>

<p>The integer data type can hold simple integer values. The
<i>minimum:</i> and <i>maximum:</i> attributes define the boundaries
and default to the boundaries as specified by the systems setup. The
<i>increment:</i> attribute defines the steps that this parameter is allowed to
take, in case there is a need to iterate this parameter.</p>

<!-- #acdattr-range -->
<h5>Range</h5>

<p>Sequence ranges have similar attribute to integers. The
<i>minimum:</i> and <i>maximum:</i> attributes define the boundaries
and default to the boundaries as specified by the systems setup. The
<i>minlength:</i> attribute defines the minimum number of values
required.</p>

<p>The <i>size:</i> attribute defines an exact number of values
required. The <i>minsize:</i> attribute defines a minimum number of values
required for ranges that can be any length. Only one of these values
should be defined for any range.</p>

<p>The value provided by the user is a list of sequence position pairs
to be interpreted by the application. The upper and lower bounds
(sequence positions can be negative to count back from the end) will
depend on the length of the sequence to which they are applied.</p>

<!-- #acdattr-string -->
<h5>String</h5>

<p>The <i>minlength:</i> attribute defines the minimum length the string must
be, the <i>maxlength:</i> attribute defines the maximum length the string
can be. The default minimum length is zero. There is no default maximum.</p>

<p>The <i>pattern:</i> attribute defines a regular expression used to
check the string value. ACD uses the Perl-compatible regular
expression library (PCRE) so any Perl-compatible regular expression should be
usable.</p>

<p>The <i>word:</i> attribute requires the result to be a valid word
with no whitespace. The default minimum length of zero allows an empty
string but this is not accepted as a word. This may change in future.</p>

<!-- #acdattr-toggle -->
<h5>Toggle</h5>

<p>Although there are (currently) no specific attributes for a toggle
ACD type, care should be taken over the definition of the
<i>information:</i> and <i>help:</i> attributes. These are used to
prompt the user (interactively or via a GUI), and to provide help
text. The text provided in each case should reflect the expected
default value of the toggle option, which may be the opposite of what
the name implies. For example, if set to "Y" by default, then the
command line option would typically be "-noxxx" where "xxx" is the
qualifier. If set to "N" by default, then the default action may be
the opposite of what the information or help text implies. If the
value is calculated, the user may need some extra guidance.</p>

<p>The <i>outputmodifier:</i> attribute is set where this parameter
changes the content or syntax of the output. This is provided for the
developers of other interfaces and parsers of EMBOSS output so that
they can fix the value, or provide parsers for each alternative.

<!-- #acdattr-section-input -->
<h5>2.4.1.2.2 Input</h5>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<!-- #section-input -->

<!-- #acdattr-codon -->
<h5>Codon</h5>

<p>Codon usage tables are species-specific, and in some cases specific
to a class of genes within a species. This makes it useful to specify
a default value for a codon usage table name. Internally, a default is
set in the ACD source code. Usually this is "Ehum.cut", the human codon
usage table provided in the EMBOSS distribution.</p>

<p>Individual codon inputs can set their own default names with the
<i>name:</i> attribute which in the current version has the same
effect as setting the <i>default:</i> attribute.</p>

<p>The <i>nullok:</i> attribute allows a default value to be replaced
by an empty string or by -noxxx on the command line if the application
can run without a data file. The application must be able to accept a
null value for this qualifier.</p>

<!-- #acdattr-cpdb -->
<h5>Cpdb</h5>

<p>Cleaned PDB file input has a default value (typically "1azu") set
in the ACD source code although this is not really a good idea.</p>

<p>Individual cpdb inputs can set their own default names with the
<i>name:</i> attribute which in the current version has the same
effect as setting the <i>default:</i> attribute.</p>


<!-- #acdattr-datafile -->
<h5>Datafile</h5>

<p>The default datafile name is defined by two ACD attributes,

by an empty string or by -noxxx on the command line if the application
can run without a data file. The application must be able to accept a
null value for this qualifier.</p>

<!-- #acdattr-directory -->
<h5>Directory</h5>

<p>The <i>extension:</i> attribute sets the extension for all
files read from the directory. Files with other extensions will not be
read</p>

<p>The <i>fullpath:</i> attribute can be used to require a full rather

<p>If a null value (the current directory) is allowed,the
<i>nullok:</i> attribute must be set true.</p>

<p>The <i>nullok:</i> attribute allows a default value to be replaced
by an empty string or by -noxxx on the command line if the application
can run without a directory. The application must be able to accept a
null value for this qualifier.</p>

<p>The <i>nulldefault:</i> attribute overrides the default name
generation, and uses an empty string (no directory) as the default for
programs where a directory is only occasionally required. If an empty
string is specified on the command line, the standard default value
will be generated instead. In combination with the <i>nullok:</i> and
<i>missing:</i> attributes, this allows qualifiers to be null by
default, and turned on from the command line.</p>

<!-- #acdattr-dirlist -->
<h5>Dirlist</h5>

<p>The <i>extension:</i> attribute sets the extension for all
files read from the directories. Files with other extensions will not be
read</p>

<p>The <i>fullpath:</i> attribute can be used to require a full rather

<i>nullok:</i> attribute must be set true.</p>

<p>The <i>nullok:</i> attribute allows a default value to be replaced
by an empty string or by -noxxx on the command line if the application
can run without a directory. The application must be able to accept a
null value for this qualifier.</p>

<!-- #acdattr-discretestates -->

<p>The discretestates data type can be replaced by a simple input
file in GUIs, with the user required to provide the correct data
format.</p>

<p>The attributes define characteristics required for Phylip
programs.</p>

length of the discrete characters string) in each set
</p>

<p>The <i>size:</i> attribute defines the number of sets of values,
usually 1 but some programs will accept multiple sets.
</p>

<p>The <i>characters:</i> attribute defines which discrete state
characters can be specified. This is defined as a string containing

can run without features input. The application must be able to accept a
null value for this qualifier.</p>

<p>The <i>nulldefault:</i> attribute overrides the default name
generation, and uses an empty string (no feature input) as the default for
programs where a directory is only occasionally required. If an empty
string is specified on the command line, the standard default value
will be generated instead. In combination with the <i>nullok:</i> and
<i>missing:</i> attributes, this allows qualifiers to be null by
default, and turned on from the command line.</p>

can run without a frequencies file.
</p>


<!-- #acdattr-infile -->
<h5>Infile</h5>

<p>The <i>binary:</i> attribute specifies that the input file is
expected to contain binary data and is not suitable for creation in
a text editor.</p>

<p>The <i>nullok:</i> attribute specifies that a missing input file is
acceptable to the application, and that -noxxx can be used on the
command line to avoid reading the default input file (if any)</p>

<p>The <i>trydefault:</i> attribute specifies that the default
filename may not exist. If <i>nullok:</i> is also defined as true then
no error is reported.</p>

<!-- #acdattr-matrix -->

can run without a properties file.
</p>


<!-- #acdattr-regexp -->
<h5>Regexp</h5>

<p>Regular expressions are processed by the "Perl-Compatible Regular
Expression Library" (PCRE). Any value must be accepted by this
library's compilation function. Some additional attributes are
provided for further validation by ACD.</p>

<i>name:</i> attribute which in the current version has the same
effect as setting the <i>default:</i> attribute.</p>

<!-- #acdattr-sequence -->
<h5>Sequence</h5>

<p>The <i>type:</i> attribute will force the sequence to be
of the given type. By default, any sequence type is accepted.</p>

<p>We recommend always defining the <i>type:</i> attribute so that the

include the full original text of the input sequence or database entry.</p>

<p>The <i>nullok:</i> attribute allows a default value to be replaced
by an empty string or by -noxxx on the command line if the application
can run without a sequence input. The application must be able to accept a
null value for this qualifier.</p>

<p>The <i>sask:</i> attribute sets the defauklt for the <i>-sask</i>
qualifier, and if set to "Y" specifies that the program will prompt
the user for a sequence begin and end position, and prompt for the
reversing of a nucleotide sequence. The EMBOSS "yank" program works
with fragments of sequences, and uses the <i>sask:</i> attribute to
prompt the user.</p>

<p>The <i>nulldefault:</i> attribute overrides the default name
generation, and uses an empty string (no sequence input) as the default for
programs where seqeunce input is only occasionally required. If an empty

<!-- #acdattr-section-selection -->
<h5>2.4.1.2.3 Selection lists</h5>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<!-- #section-selection -->

<p>For both selection list types, the values that
the user can choose from are defined in the <i>values:</i> attribute as a
string, delimited by the character that is given by the <i>delimiter:</i>
attribute (which defaults to the semi-colon ';'). For the <i>list</i> data type
there is a second delimiter ( <i>codedelimiter:</i>) character that defines the
delimiter that separates the label from the value (defaults to the colon
":"). The <i>minimum:</i> and <i>maximum:</i> attributes define the number of
choices that this parameter can handle. The <i>header:</i> attribute will hold
the text that is displayed above the option list. The <i>casesensitive:</i>
attribute will indicate if the options are case sensitive or not, but the value
of the parameter will be exactly what the list value is. The <i>button:</i>
attribute, which can either be Y(es) or N(o), is used in for web front ends, to
indicate if radiobuttons/checkbox/selection lists are to be used or if the list
is simply displayed with a text entry box beneath it, to enter the option.</p>

<!-- #acdattr-list -->
<h5>List</h5>

<p>The <i>values:</i> attribute contains the list of valid code names and
values. The <i>delimiter:</i> and <i>codedelimiter:</i> attributes

selections required. By default, 1 selection is required.</p>

<p>The <i>maximum:</i> attribute specifies the maximum number of
selections required. By default, exactly 1 selection is required. A
higher value allows multiple selections.</p>

<p>The <i>header:</i> attribute defines text to appear before the list
is presented to the user. The <i>information:</i> attribute defines
text to be used as a prompt after the list.</p>

<p>The <i>delimiter:</i> attribute specifies the character used in the
<i>values:</i> string to separate list items.</p>

<p>The <i>codedelimiter:</i> attribute  specifies the character used in the
<i>values:</i> string to separate codes (names) and descriptions of
list items.</p>

<p>The <i>button:</i> attribute suggests whether a list is best
represented as checkboxes or radio buttons in an interface (value "Y")
or as a pull-down list.</p>

<p>The <i>casesensitive:</i> attribute defines whether the input must
match the exact case of the selection list item.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
list: matrix [
     default: "blosum"   # default value
     minimum: 1 maximum: 1   # must select exactly 1
     header: "Comparison matrices" # printed before list

<h3>2.4.2 Calculated attributes</h3>

<p>Calculated attributes are attributes that are
assigned values (calculated in some points) AFTER the parameter has been
validated (for instance, for a sequence data type, the sequence file has been
checked to exist and read in). The values are extracted from the actual object
the parameter is referring to. At the moment the calculated attributes are only
referring to sequence type objects and can hold things like the name of the
sequence, the length, the type of sequence (Protein, DNA, RNA etc).</p>

<a name="sect2421">&nbsp;</a>
<h4>2.4.2.1 Data type-specific calculated attributes</h4>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<!-- #tablecalc -->


<a name="sect2422">&nbsp;</a>
<h4>2.4.2.2 The sequence type: attribute </h4>

<p>The <i>type:</i> attribute will describe the type of the sequence
in a single token. The EMBOSS initialisation routines will try to
establish the type, by reading the (first) sequence and examining the
contents. Possible values for the <i>type:</i> attribute are listed in
table 8.</p>


<!-- #tableseq -->

<a name="sect243">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>2.4.3 Attribute usage</h3>

<p>The values of attributes (default, specific and
calculated) can be referred to <b>after</b> they have been defined by appending
the attribute name to the parameter name, spaced by a dot '.' and enclosing it
in parentheses, prefixed by a dollar sign '$'.</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<p>$(<i>parametername.attribute</i>)</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
sequence: asequence [
    standard: Y
    prompt: "Enter filename"
  ]


integer: windowsize [
    default: $(asequence.length)
  ]
</pre>

<p>In this example the parameter <i>windowsize</i>
will default to the length of the input sequence.</p>

<a name="sect25">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>2.5 Qualifiers</h2>

<p>For many of the parameters/objects, qualifiers
can be used to specify the properties of that object on the command line. The
format of a sequence file (data type '<i>sequence</i>') can be specified by a
qualifier as being, for instance, 'fasta'. These types of qualifiers are
specific for a particular data type (or object) and are therefore called data
type specific qualifiers.</p>

<p>A second type of qualifier is independent of the data types. These
are the global qualifiers and apply to the complete program. They are
usually used to change the behaviour of the program.  Qualifiers can
be set to turn the debugging on, for instance (by using the
<i>-debug</i> qualifier), or it can instruct the program to behave
like a filter, reading from the standard input and writing to the
standard output ( <i>-filter</i> qualifier).</p>

<p>Qualifiers can be entered on the command line
in a myriad of ways and a full description of the command line syntax will be
given in 1.4. For the moment qualifiers will be used in the UNIX style, which
means that a qualifier name is prefixed with an hyphen and the value (if
necessary) will be spaced from the qualifier by a space.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
% <b>seqret</b> <i>sequence.seq</i> <u>-sformat fasta</u>
</pre>

<p><i>"-sformat fasta"</i> is a <i>"qualifier/value pair"</i>.
Where <b>seqret</b> is the program being called, <i>sequence.seq</i> the first
(and only) parameter and <i>-sformat fasta</i> the qualifier/value pair for
this parameter.</p>

<p>The global qualifiers are boolean qualifiers and can be set by
naming them on the command line and specifically unset by prefixing
the qualifier with 'no', but since the global qualifiers all default
to false anyway, there is no specific need to use this syntax at the
moment.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
% <b>seqret</b> <i>sequence.seq</i> -debug


% <b>seqret</b> <i>sequence.seq</i> -nodebug
</pre>

<p>In the first example <b>seqret</b> is the program being called,
<i>sequence.seq</i> the first (and only) parameter and <i>-debug
</i>instructs the program to turn debugging on. In the second example
<b>seqret</b> is run with the same parameter, but the <i>-debug</i>
qualifier is now prefixed with ' <i>no</i>', instructing the program to
turn debugging off (this could be useful if debugging was turned on by
default in the resource files or in an environment variable).</p>

<a name="sect251">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>2.5.1 Naming scheme for qualifiers</h3>

<p>Qualifiers can have any name, but a recommended
naming scheme is used at the moment. The first one or two letters of the
qualifier indicate the data type they are related to. 'OS' is used for the
output sequence data types (outseq, outseqset and outseqall) and 'S' for the
input sequence data types (sequence, seqset and seqall). The rest of the
qualifiers' name is free but should be something sensible related to the data
type.</p>

<a name="sect252">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>2.5.2 Global qualifiers</h3>

<p>Global qualifiers can change the behaviour of the program. They are
boolean qualifiers and can be set by naming them on the command line
and specifically unset by prefixing the qualifier with '<i>no</i>'
<a name="fnB2"></a>
<a href="#fn2">[2]</a>.
The qualifiers can be used on the EMBOSS program and as a qualifier
for <b>acdc</b>. The current global qualifiers are listed in the table
below.</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<!-- #tablequals -->


<a name="sect2521">&nbsp;</a>
<h4>2.5.2.1 Global qualifier description</h4>

<a name="sect25211">&nbsp;</a>
<h5>2.5.2.1.1 acdlog (for testing only)</h5>

<p>This qualifier will turn on the log function of the ACD file
processing. It will produce a logfile of the ACD file parsing
process. The logfile will have the name of the application, with the
extension <i>.acdlog</i>.
</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
% <b>seqret</b> <i>sequence.seq</i> -acdlog -auto
% <b>more</b> <i>seqret.acdlog</i>

  seqret [
    sequence: sequence [
       parameter: "1"
      ]
    seqout: outseq [
      parameter: "2"
    ]
-- All Done --

Definitions in ACD file
  ACD 0
  Name: 'seqret'
..(Removed lines)..
</pre>

<p>This example shows the application <b>seqret</b> being run with the
<i>-acdlog</i> qualifier (and the <i>-auto</i> qualifier, (which will
be discussed later). After completion of the program a file called
<i>seqret.acdlog</i> is created in the current directory, with the
logging information, of which the first sixteen lines are shown.</p>

<p>The logfile will first list the ACD file
description, with all abbreviated names extended to their full length. Next, it
will list all the parameters and qualifiers it knows of and prints out all the
information it has on the data types and qualifiers.</p>

<a name="sect25212">&nbsp;</a>
<h5>2.5.2.1.2 acdpretty (for testing only)</h5>

<p>When the <i>-acdpretty</i> qualifier is used,
an ACD file will be produced which is a formatted version of the original ACD
file. It will produce the full-length names of all data type names, attributes
and qualifiers. It will show all attributes on a separate line and all values
enclosed in quotes. The file will be saved as <i>programname.acdpretty</i> in
the current directory ( <i>programname</i> is the name of the original
program).</p>

<a name="sect25213">&nbsp;</a>
<h5>2.5.2.1.3 auto</h5>

<p>The <i>-auto</i> qualifier will turn off any
prompting of the user. It will try to run the program with all the default
settings that are defined in the ACD file. If a parameter does not have a
default value and it is flagged as required, the program will stop and produce
an error message.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
% <b>seqret</b> <i>sequence.seq</i>
Output sequence [pdnirsecf.fasta]:

% <b>seqret</b> <i>sequence.seq</i> -auto
%
</pre>

<p>The first example shows the application <b>seqret</b> being run
without the <i>-auto</i> qualifier. The program will prompt the user
for an output filename, because the output sequence is a mandatory
parameter.  It presents the user with a prompt and a default output
filename ( <i>pdnirsecf.fasta</i>, constructed from the input sequence
name and the output format).</p>

<p>In the second example, the application <b>seqret</b>
is run with the <i>-auto</i> qualifier. The user is not queried for the output
filename and it will use the default filename( <i>pdnirsecf.fasta</i>) for the
output file.</p>

<a name="sect25214">&nbsp;</a>
<h5>2.5.2.1.4 debug</h5>

<p>This qualifier will turn on the debug tracing.  A file will be
produced with the name of the program followed by the extension
<i>.dbg</i>.  The debug file will contain a complete trace of the
actions of the program reported by calls to the AJAX function
<i>ajDebug()</i>.</p>

<p>This examples shows the application <b>seqret</b> being run with
the <i>-debug</i> qualifier (and the <i>-auto</i> qualifier, which
will be discussed later). After completion of the program, a file
called <i>seqret.dbg</i> is created in the current directory which
contains the debug information, of which some of the lines are
shown.</p>

<a name="sect25215">&nbsp;</a>
<h5>2.5.2.1.5 filter</h5>

<p>The filter qualifier makes the program behave
like a filter, reading its (first) input 'file' from the standard input, and
writing its (first) output 'file' to the standard output. The -filter qualifier
will also invoke the -auto qualifier, so the user is never prompted for any
missing values.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
% cat <i>sequence.seq</i> | <b>seqret</b> <i>-filter</i> |  lpr
</pre>

<p>The example shows the application <b>seqret</b>
being run with the <i>-filter</i> qualifier. The input file is 'piped' into the
program using the Unix command <i>cat</i> and the output is 'piped' directly to
the Unix program <i>lpr</i>, which will print it on the printer.</p>

<a name="sect25216">&nbsp;</a>
<h5>2.5.2.1.6 help</h5>

<p>Help on a program's use can be obtained by
using the <i>-help</i> qualifier. The help that is displayed will be
automatically produced from the information in the ACD file. It will list all
the parameters and their associated qualifiers. It will show the names of the
parameters and qualifiers, their type and a brief help text, that is extracted
from the <i>help:</i> attribute.</p>

<p>A second qualifier <i>-verbose</i> gives a list
of all available qualifiers, including any associated qualifiers (sequence
formatting etc) and the general qualifiers such as <i>-help</i>.</p>

<a name="sect25217">&nbsp;</a>
<h5>2.5.2.1.7 options</h5>

<p>A program wirll prompt the user for any missing "required" or
"parameter" values. Some programs have more options that are normally
not prompted for (although they can be used on the command line). When
the <i>-options</i> qualifier is used, the program will query the user
for the required parameters (data types with the <i>parameter:</i>
attribute and/or <i>standard:</i> attribute) and also for the
parameters that are labelled with the <i>additional:</i>
attribute.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>ACD file definition :</p>

<pre>
application: seqdemo

sequence: asequence [
    parameter: Y
  ]

outseq: outseq [
    standard: Y
  ]

integer: outputLength [
    additional: Y
    information: "Output length"
  ]
</pre>

<p>Command line :</p>

<pre>
% <b>seqdemo</b>
Input sequence: <i>sequence.seq</i>
Output sequence [pdnirsecf.fasta]: <i>&lt;ENTER&gt;</i>

% <b>seqdemo</b> <i>-options</i>
Input sequence: <i>sequence.seq</i>
Output sequence [pdnirsecf.fasta]: <i>&lt;ENTER&gt;</i>
Output length: <i>10</i>
</pre>

<p>In the first example the application <b>seqdemo</b>
is run without any parameters or qualifiers and since the <i>asequence</i>
parameter is a parameter it queries the user for the input filename. It also
queries the user for the output sequence, since that parameter is labelled as
being required by the attribute of that name. It will not query the user for
the integer variable <i>outputLength</i>, since it is not labelled as a
parameter and is not labelled as required.</p>

<p>In the second example the user IS queried for the integer, since
the <i>-options</i> qualifier forces the program to query for those
parameters that are labelled with the <i>additional:</i>
attribute.</p>

<p>Any parameter that is not defined as a parameter (with the
<i>parameter:</i> attribute), as required (by the <i>standard:</i>
attribute) or as optional (by the <i>additional:</i> attribute) can
still be used on the command line, but the user will NEVER be queried
for them. These parameters are considered an 'advanced feature' and
can only be used on the command line. They will only be shown by the
<i>-help</i> qualifier.</p>

<a name="sect25218">&nbsp;</a>
<h5>2.5.2.1.8 stdout</h5>

<p>When the <i>-stdout</i> qualifier is used, the
user will still be prompted for all the info that is required, but will write
to standard output. The user will also still be prompted for an output
filename, in case the user wants to save the output to a file.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>Command line :</p>

<pre>
% <b>seqret</b> -stdout
Input sequence: <i>sequence.seq</i>
Output sequence [stdout]: <i>&lt;ENTER&gt;</i>
</pre>

<p>In this example the <i>-stdout</i> qualifier
changes the default output to be to standard output (the terminal) instead of
to a file. The program can still prompt the user, so there is a chance to enter
a filename instead. With <i>-auto</i> on the command line, the program would
instead write to the terminal without asking.</p>

<a name="sect2522">&nbsp;</a>
<h4>2.5.2.2 Environment variables EMBOSS_qualifier</h4>

<p>Most global qualifiers default to FALSE unless
they are set on the command line or the environment variable is set to TRUE
(the exceptions are the message level qualifiers <i>-warning</i> <i>-error</i>
and <i>-fatal</i>). The actions of all the global qualifiers can be changed by
using environment variables. Environment variables will override the default
action of the program. The variables are constructed of the word EMBOSS (all
capitals) and the name of the qualifier (also in capitals) divided by the
underscore character '_'. If set, they can be set with YES, TRUE or 1. Both
lowercase and uppercase is accepted, as is using only a part of the word YES or
TRUE (i.e. Y and T)</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<pre>(csh)
   setenv EMBOSS_<i>QUAL</i> TRUE
or setenv EMBOSS_<i>QUAL</i> true

   setenv EMBOSS_<i>QUAL</i> YES
or setenv EMBOSS_<i>QUAL</i> yes

   setenv EMBOSS_<i>QUAL</i> 1

(sh or bash)
   export EMBOSS_QUAL=YES
</pre>

<p>where <i>QUAL</i> represents the name of the
global qualifier.</p>

<p>The table below lists all environment variables
for global qualifiers.</p>

<!-- #tablequalvars -->


<p>Environment variables can be specified in the global
<i>emboss.defaults</i> file, in the user's <i>.embosssrc</i> file or set on the
command line with the <i>setenv </i>command.</p>

<p>When the environment variable is set, its
effect can be cancelled by using the negating action of prefixing 'no' to the
boolean qualifier name with the program name.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>ACD file definition :</p>

<pre>
application: seqdemo

  sequence: asequence [
    parameter: Y
  ]

  outseq: outseq [
    parameter: Y
  ]

  integer: outputLength [
    additional: Y
  ]
</pre>

<p>Command line :</p>

<p>Example 1</p>

<pre>
% <b>seqdemo</b>
Input sequence: <i>sequence.seq</i>
Output sequence [pdnirsecf.fasta]: <i>&lt;ENTER&gt;</i>

% <b>seqdemo</b> <i>-options</i>
Input sequence: <i>sequence.seq</i>
Output sequence [pdnirsecf.fasta]: <i>&lt;ENTER&gt;</i>
Output length: <i>10</i>
</pre>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<pre>
% setenv EMBOSS_OPTIONS YES
% <b>seqdemo</b>
Input sequence: <i>sequence.seq</i>
Output sequence [pdnirsecf.fasta]: <i>&lt;ENTER&gt;</i>
Output length: <i>10</i>

% <b>seqdemo</b> <i>-nooptions</i>
Input sequence: <i>sequence.seq</i>
Output sequence [pdnirsecf.fasta]: <i>&lt;ENTER&gt;</i>
</pre>

<p>The first example shows the behaviour without the EMBOSS_OPTIONS
environment variable being set. The program <b>seqdemo</b> behaves in
the standard way, and only asks for the <i>outputLength</i> parameter
when the <i>-options</i> qualifier is used. In the second example the
environment variable <i>EMBOSS_OPTIONS</i> is set at the command line
and the effect of it is that it now asks for the <i>outputLength</i>
parameter without the <i>-options</i> qualifier being used. The effect
of the environment variable is cancelled by using the negating effect
of the prefix ' <i>no</i>' to the qualifier <i>-options</i> (giving
<i>-nooptions</i>).</p>

<h3>2.5.4 Multiple qualifiers</h3>

<p>Qualifiers refer to the parameter that preceded
the qualifier, until a parameter from the same data type appears on the command
line. But, qualifiers that are specific for different data types can be
intermixed. If there are no two parameters of equal type, the order of
parameters and their qualifiers is irrelevant.</p>

<p>Example 1</p>

<pre>
% <b>seqret</b> <i>in.seq out.seq</i> -sformat fasta -osformat gcg
</pre>

<p>In this example, the program <b>seqret</b>
takes two parameters, an input sequence (file <i>in.seq</i>, data type
'sequence') and an output sequence (file <i>out.seq</i>, data type 'outseq')
and the order of the qualifiers is irrelevant, since the two qualifiers refer
to different data types.</p>

<p>Example 2</p>

<pre>
% <b>align</b> <i>aap.seq</i> -sformat fasta <i> noot.seq </i> -sformat gcg
</pre>

<p>In this example, the program <b>align</b> takes two parameters,
both input sequences (files <i>aap.seq</i> and <i>noot.seq</i>, data
type sequence) and here the order of the qualifiers is
important. Since <i>aap.seq</i> is in 'fasta' format and
<i>noot.seq</i> is in 'gcg' format.</p>

<a name="sect255">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>2.5.5 Numbering qualifiers</h3>

<p>Instead of having to adhere to a rigorous order
for the qualifiers when two or more parameters of the same data type are
defined, it is also possible to use numbers in the qualifiers name, to indicate
to which parameter the qualifier is referring.</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<p>-<i>qualifiername</i>#&nbsp;<i>qualifiervalue</i>
</p>

<p>where # represents an integer number,
indicating which parameter the qualifier is referring to.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
% <b>align</b> <i>aap.seq</i> <i>noot.seq</i> -sformat2 gcg -sformat1 fasta
</pre>

<p>Is similar to example 2 above, but uses the
qualifier numbering, to indicate that the format of the first parameter is
'fasta' and the second 'gcg'.</p>

<p>The number that is used is not the number of
the parameter in the ACD definition, but indicates the number of SIMILLAR
qualifiers.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>#ACD definition</p>

<pre>application: seqtest
sequence: asequence1 [
    parameter: Y
  ]

outfile:  outfile     [
    parameter: Y
  ]

sequence: asequence2 [
    parameter: Y
  ]
</pre>

<p>Command line :</p>

<pre>
% <b>seqtest</b> <i>filename1.seq</i> seqtest.out <i>filename2.seq</i> \
  -sformat1 gcg -sformat2 fasta
</pre>

<p>Defines that the first sequence file
(filename1.seq) is in 'gcg' format and the second sequence file (filename2.seq)
is in 'fasta' format. Note that the second -sformat qualifier has been numbered
2, although it is the third parameter (but the second sequence parameter, hence
number 2).</p>

<a name="sect26">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>2.6 Operations</h2>

<p>Operations can be used to be more flexible in
the ACD syntax. At the moment there are arithmetic and conditional operations.
An operation is enclosed in a pair of parenthesis '()' and preceded by the at
symbol '@'.</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<p>@(<i>operation</i>)</p>

<p>If the operation contains white spaces, the
whole token should be enclosed by double quotes (" ")</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<pre>
"@(<i>operation with white space </i>)"
</pre>

<p>Operations can be nested.</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<pre>
@(@(<i>operation</i>))</a>
</pre>

<a name="sect261">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>2.6.1 Arithmetic operations</h3>

<p>The current arithmetic operations are addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division. The standard characters for the
arithmetic operations are used: + - * and /.</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<pre>
@(<i>a+b</i>) (Addition)

@(<i>a-b</i>) (Subtraction)

@(<i>a*b</i>) (Multiplication)

@(<i>a/b</i>) (Division)
</pre>

<p>The operands <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> must parse
to an integer or a float value. Only a single arithmetic operation is allowed
per operation. If more then one arithmetic operation is required, one should
make use of internal ACD variables to hold the intermediate results or nest
separate @() operations.</p>

<p>Example1:</p>

<pre>
variable: protlen "@( $(sequence.length) / 3 )"

integer: window  [
    maximum: "@($(protlen)-50)"
    default: 50
  ]
</pre>

<p>This is an example of using an internal ACD variable, to store the
intermediate result. The internal ACD variable <i>$(protlen)</i> is
calculated from the length of the input sequence ( <i>sequence</i> data
type) and used in the definition of maximum size of the <i>window
</i>parameter.</p>

<p>Example2:</p>

<pre>
integer: window [
    maximum: "@( @( $(sequence.length) / 3) - 50)"
    default: 50
  ]
</pre>

<p>This is an example using nesting of operations,
achieving the same result as example1. The <i>window </i>parameter is
calculated directly from the <i>sequence.length</i> variable (calculated
attribute) by first dividing the sequence length by 3, using the divide
arithmetic operation, nested with a separate subtraction operation.</p>

<p>If any of the operands are not numerical, the
result is undefined.</p>

<a name="sect262">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>2.6.2 Conditional operations</h3>

<p>There are three conditional operations: The
Boolean operation, the simple conditional (if/then/else type) and the case
type.</p>

<a name="sect2621">&nbsp;</a>
<h4>2.6.2.1 Boolean operation</h4>

<p>The Boolean operation will resolve to a Boolean
variable using any of the four conditional operators, for equality (==),
non-equality (!=), less-than (&lt;) and greater-than (&gt;).</p>

<p><b>Formalised:</b></p>

<pre>
@(<i>token1==token2</i>) (Equality)

@(<i>token1!=token2</i>) (Non-equality)

@(<i>token1&lt;token2</i>) (Less-than)

@(<i>token1&gt;token2</i>) (Greater-than)

@(!<i>token1</i>) (Not)

@(<i>token1|token2</i>) (Or)

@(<i>token1&amp;token2</i>) (And)
</pre>

<p>The test values can be integers, floats and
strings.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
sequence: seq [
    standard: Y
  ]

infile:  data [
    standard: @(seq.type==DNA)
  ]
</pre>

<p>In this example, the data file is only required
if the type of sequence is 'DNA'.</p>

<a name="sect2622">&nbsp;</a>
<h4>2.6.2.2 Simple conditional operation.</h4>

<p>The simple conditional is a tri-operand operator. The test value is
followed by a question mark '?', which in turn is followed by the two
values the operation can resolve to, separated by a colon
':'. <b>Formalised:</b>
</p>

<p>@(<i>boolval ? iftrue : iffalse</i>)</p>

<p>The test value, <i>boolval</i>, which must be either a Boolean
variable, a Boolean operation or an integer, is examined and if it
resolves to true (or non-zero) the total operation resolves to the
<i>iftrue</i> value. If the test value resolves to false (or zero) the
operation resolves to the second value ( <i>iffalse</i>.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
string: matrix [
    default: "@($(asequence.protein) ? BLOSUM62 : DNAMAT)"
  ]
</pre>

<p>The <i>$(sequence.protein)</i> variable is a Boolean value that
resolves to true if the <i>sequence</i> data type with the name
<i>asequence</i> is a protein sequence. The operation would resolve to
<i>BLOSUM62</i> if the sequence is a protein sequence and resolve to
<i>DNAMAT</i> if it was not a protein sequence (i.e. a DNA or RNA
sequence).</p>

<p>From EMBOSS 2.8.0 the preferred method is to use the automatic ACD
variable $(acdprotein) which is set to the type of the first input
sequence. This makes the conversion of ACD files for GUI interfaces and other
wrappers simpler. The examlpe then becomes:</p>

<pre>
string: matrix [
    default: "@($(acdprotein) ? BLOSUM62 : DNAMAT)"
  ]
</pre>

<p>The results will be the same because internally EMBOSS will use the
value of "$(asequence.protein)"</p>

<a name="sect2623">&nbsp;</a>
<h4>2.6.2.3 Case operation.</h4>

<p>In the case-type operation, the test value is
compared with a list of possible values. If a match is found, the operation
resolves to the result associated with that possible value. The test value,
which is parsed as a string, is followed by an equal sign '=', which in turn is
followed by one or more pairs of possible and associated values, separated by a
colon ':'. If none of the possible values match, the operation will resolve to
the default result, that is associated with the keyword <i>else</i>.</p>

<p>The else : default value pair is not mandatory
and if none of the possible values match in a operation without the default
value, the operation will resolve to a null string. <b>Formalised:</b></p>

<p>@(<i>testval = poss_valA : ass_valA poss_valB :
ass_valB</i> else<i> : default_val</i>)</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
string: matrix [
    default: "@($(sequence.type) =
          protein : BLOSUM62
          dna : dnamat
          rna : rnamat
          else : unknown)"
  ]
</pre>

<p>The <i>$(sequence.type)</i> variable is a
string value that holds the type of sequence present in the <i>sequence</i>data
type, with the name <i>sequence.</i> If the type is <i>'protein'</i>, the
operation resolves to <i>BLOSUM62</i>, if the type is <i>'dna'</i> it resolves
to <i>DNAMAT</i>, etc. If the type is not in this list, the operation resolves
to unknown.</p>

<p>If the test value cannot unambiguously be
assigned to a single associated value, the operation will resolve to the LAST
associated value that matches its possible value.</p>

<a name="sect27">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>2.7 Variables</h3>

<p>The use of conditional operations in ACD files is often to test the
values of <i>list</i> or <i>selection</i> data types.</p>

<p>These tests are often used for several other qualifiers. To help
understand the ACD file, and to help the developers of ACD parsers, an
ACD file can use a <i>variable</i> definition to define the result
once only, and then to refer to the variable by name in all later ACD
data type definitions.</p>

<p>Example1:</p>

<pre>
variable: usermatrix "@($(pwmatrix) == o)"

infile: pairwisedata [
  additional: "$(usermatrix)"
  default: ""
  nullok: "@(!$(usermatrix))"
  information: "Filename of user pairwise matrix"
  knowntype: "comparison matrix"
]

</pre>

<p>Note that as a variable only has a single value and no attributes the
square brackets are not used.</p>

<p>Variables are used to simplify the ACD file, but they do indicate
that there is some complexity in the ACD definitions. When a variable
is used, or when a conditional operation refers to another ACD
value, the application can be regarded as two or more separate
applications with each possible condition resolved.</p>

<a name="sect28">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>2.8 Sections</h3>

<p>The parameters and qualifiers defined by an ACD file are processed
in the order in which they appear. This is sufficient for ACD
processing by EMBOSS applications, but does not give enough detail for
user interfaces to build clean groupings of options.</p>

<p>To help user interfaces, all ACD parameters and qualifiers are now
grouped into 5 major sections and in some cases into subsections. The
5 major sections always appear in the following order in the ACD file
(the order is tested by the acdvalid tool):</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Section name</b></td>
<td><b>Description</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Input</td>
<td>Input values, including any infile, sequence, seqset, seqall,
matrix, fmatrix, codon, or any
other ACD type that will read input. At present datafile is included,
although this may change. Other qualifiers related to input
can also be placed in this section.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Required</td>
<td>Parameters and required qualifiers, including
any whose "additional" attribute can be true but depends on a
conditional operation. Also any toggles that their definitions
use. Note that input and output parameters and qualifiers must be in
their respective sections. Other qualifiers related to input and
output can also be placed in those sections.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Additional</td>
<td>Additional qualifiers, including any whose "additional" attribute
can be true but depends on a conditional operation. Also any toggles
that their definitions use. Note that input and output parameters and
qualifiers must be in their respective sections. Other qualifiers
related to input and output can also be placed in those sections.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Advanced</td>
<td>Any qualifiers (except input and output qualifiers) which have no
"standard" or "additional" attribute defined. Other qualifiers
related to input and output can also be placed in those sections.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Output</td>
<td>Output values, including any outfile, outdata, seqout, seqoutall,
seqoutset, outtree or any other data type that will write output. This
is the last section to be defined, so all output definitions must be
at the end. Other qualifiers related to output
can also be placed in this section.</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>All sections and subsections are defined in the file
<b>sections.standard</b> which is stored and installed in the same
directory as the ACD files.</p>

<a name="sect29">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>2.9 Environment variables</h3>

<p>The behaviour of EMBOSS programs can not only
be influenced by command line options, but also by environment variables. Some
of the environment variables were already mentioned in section 3.4.2.2 for the
global qualifiers and they are listed here also, for completeness. There are a
few others that are not directly related to specific data types, but are more
general to the workings of an EMBOSS program.</p>


<p>All environment variables should be described in the file
<b>variables.standard</b> which is stored and installed in the same
directory as the ACD files and is used to generate the table
below. Unlike the other .standard files, there is no explicit test for
a variable to be defined in this file.</p>

<!-- #tableothervars -->


<a name="sect3">&nbsp;</a>
<h1>3. ACD utility programs</h1>


<p>A set of 6 utility programs will run, test and document an ACD file
without the need to write the program which will use the ACD file.</p>

<p>The recommended approach for developing new applications is to
first write and test the ACD file and then to write the application to
use the values defined by the ACD file.


<a name="sect31">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>3.1 acdc</h2>


<p>The <b>acdc</b> utility processes an ACD file in exactly the same
way as an application, even if the application itself has not yet been
written.</p>

<p><b>acdc</b> can use general qualifiers such as -debug. Note that as
the input files are read any debug calls made by the input functions
will be reported.



<a name="sect32">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>3.2 acdtrace</h2>


<p>The <b>acdtrace</b> utility runs like acdc but also reports the
resolution of any ACD varaibles and operations as the file is
processed. The output on screen can look a little confusing but is by
far the best way to see how variables and operations work in your ACD file.</p>



<a name="sect33">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>3.3 acdvalid</h2>


<p>The <b>acdvalid</b> utility validates an ACD file, testing many
features which will not prevent an application from running, but will
create problems for the user interface (commandline or some
wrapper).</p>

<p>Among the features tested by <b>acdvalid</b> are:</p>

<ul>

<li>sections in the correct order of input, required, additional,
advanced and output</li>

<li>calculated values for the <i>parameter</i> <i>standard</i> and
<i>additional</i> attributes. These can use "toggle" data type values
but not "boolean", so that interface wrappers can use "toggle" values
to split an application into 2 or more simpler definitions.</li>

<li><i>knowntype</i> attributes are defined for the data type in the
<b>knowntypes.standard</b> file or match an accepted standard format
for the data type</li>

<li>qualifier names match an accepted standard, for example all
sequence input should end in "sequence". The warning message will
explain what the standard requires</li>

<li>qualifiers that are restricted to one section (input or output)
are ni the correct section</li>

<li>Other qualifiers are valid in the section ni which they appear,
for example the "advanced" section cannot have any qualifier that will
be prompted, and the "additional" section can only have qualifiers
whose <i>additional</i> attribute is set, or toggles which control them.</li>

<li>sections and subsections must be defined in the
<b>sections.standard</b> file</li>

<li><i>parameter</i>, <i>standard</i> and <i>additional</i> attribute
values cannot be "N" (the default) because this confuses parsers.</li>

<li>section definitions must use a standard <i>information</i>
attribute so that interface wrappers will have a consistent
description when using sections to group qualifiers.</li>

<li>The text values defined for <i>information</i> and other
attributes should start in upper case</li>

<li>Data types with standard prompts should not have
<i>information</i> or <i>prompt</i> attributes</li>

</ul>


<p>If the message is a "Warning" then the ACD file will work, although
it is worth trying to fix the problem. Recommended solutions are
described in the web page
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~pmr/emboss/acdvalid-fix.html used by the
developers
</p>

<p>Further validation tests will be added in future releases so it is
worth running acdvalid on all local ACD files with each new version of
EMBOSS</p>


<a name="sect34">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>3.4 acdpretty</h2>


<p>The <b>acdpretty</b> utility simply reads an ACD file and rewrites
it with clean indentation to file <b>(programname).acdpretty</b> which
can be used to overwrite the original ACD file.</p>



<a name="sect35">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>3.5 acdtable</h2>


<p>The <b>acdtable</b> utility is used to create the table of
qualifiers, allowed values and defaults that appears in the
application documentation. The allowed values uses the <i>valid</i>
attribute, and the default value uses the <i>expect</i> attribute for
cases where the ACD definition alone is not enough to define the value
to be reported.</p>



<a name="sect36">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>3.6 acdlog</h2>


<p>The <b>acdc</b> utility</p> runs like <b>acdc</b> but also produces
a file <i>(programname).acdlog</i> which documents the internals of
ACD processing.



<a name="sect4">&nbsp;</a>
<h1>4. Command line syntax</h1>

<p>Most of the EMBOSS programs will be started
from the UNIX command line, either with or without extra parameters and
qualifiers. Which parameters and qualifiers can appear on the command line, is
defined in the Ajax Command Definition (ACD) file that is associated with the
EMBOSS program (See 1.2).</p>

<p>The Command line syntax is very versatile and it does not restrict
the available syntax more than is strictly necessary. To save
confusion, there will be a recommended EMBOSS command style, which
probably will be the UNIX style using '=' for parameter and qualifier
values.</p>

<a name="sect41">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>4.1 Parameters and qualifiers.</h2>

<p>For parameters it is not always mandatory to
use the name of the parameter on the command line. If the <i>parameter:</i>
attribute was used for a parameter it is not mandatory to use the name of the
parameter as a prefix to the parameter value (See 3.4.1.1.1). For qualifiers it
is always mandatory to provide the name of the qualifier (if a value for the
qualifier is to be given on the command line).</p>

<p>In the rest of the definition of the command
line syntax, wherever the word qualifier is used, it means both parameters and
qualifiers. If 'parameter' is used it will only apply to parameters.</p>

<a name="sect42">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>4.2 Qualifier definition</h2>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>Qualifiers are meaningful words rather than single letters. </li>
 <li>Qualifiers are not case sensitive.</li>
 <li>Qualifier values are usually not case sensitive. An obvious
     exception is filenames, which must match in normal UNIX style (on normal
     UNIX systems). </li>
 <li>Qualifiers can be shortened as long as they are not ambiguous. </li>
 <li>Qualifiers can appear in any order, although in some cases their
     scope changes. </li>
 <li>Associated qualifiers, specific for a certain data type, should
     immediately follow a parameter of that data type. In this position, these
     qualifiers apply only to that parameter and not to all parameters of that
     data type. </li>
 <li>Qualifiers must start with either the hyphen '-' (UNIX style) or
     the forward slash '/' (OpenVMS style), unless there is an '=' sign between
     the qualifier and the value (SeqPup command style). </li>
 <li>The values are spaced from the qualifier name by either a space ' '
     (UNIX style) or an equal sign '=' (OpenVMS or SeqPup style). </li>
 <li>If the equal sign '=' is used to assign a value to a qualifier, the
     prefix (hyphen '-' or forward slash '/') can be omitted (SeqPup
     style).</li>
 <li>Boolean (Yes/No) (True/False) qualifiers have no attached value and
     are set True by giving the qualifier name, and set to False by adding the
     prefix 'no' to the qualifier name. </li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>ACD definition</p>

<pre>
application: seqdemo

sequence: asequence [
    parameter: Y
  ]

boolean:     output     [
    default: Y
  ]
</pre>

<p>Command line :</p>

<pre>
% <b>seqdemo</b> <i>filename.seq</i> -output

% <b>seqdemo</b> <i>filename.seq</i> -nooutput
</pre>

<p>In the first command line example the bool parameter <i>output</i>
is set to True (although it could have been omitted since the default
value is True).</p>

<p>In the second command line example the <i>output</i> parameter is
set to False, by the prefix 'no'.</p>

<p>Sequence specifications conform to the EMBOSS Uniform Sequence
Address, but parts of the specification can also be given on the
command line.</p>

<p>Examples</p>

<p>The following command lines all tell <b>seqdemo</b> to read
sequence <i>paamir.tfa</i> in fasta format, starting at base 25.</p>

<pre>
% <b>seqdemo</b> -sbeg 25 paamir.tfa -sf fasta

% <b>seqdemo</b> fasta::paamir.tfa -sbegin=25 

% <b>seqdemo</b> -sbegin=25 fasta::paamir.tfa 

% <b>seqdemo</b> -sbegin=25 paamir.tfa -sformat fasta

% <b>seqdemo</b> -sbeg 25 paamir.tfa -sf=fasta

% <b>seqdemo</b> -sbeg 25 -sequence=paamir.tfa -sf=fasta

% <b>seqdemo</b> sbeg=25 -sequence=paamir.tfa sf=fasta

% <b>seqdemo</b> -sbeg 25 -sequence paamir.tfa -sf fasta

% <b>seqdemo</b> /SBEG=25 /SEQUENCE=paamir.tfa /SF=fasta
</pre>

<p>This may seem rather confusing, but only because there is no
enforcement of a standard recommended way for users to specify the
command lines.</p>

<p>For general use, we strongly recommend the
first example above.</p>

<a name="sect5">&nbsp;</a>
<h1>5. Using an ACD file in a new EMBOSS program</h1>

<p>This part is intended as a simple guide to getting started as a
developer using EMBOSS. EMBOSS is a new package, and can seem
difficult at first. If you follow these steps you will find it can be
easy.</p>

<p>We start by assuming you want to write a new application. You will
need to write the application source code, which will use the EMBOSS
libraries, and you also need to add the application to EMBOSS.</p>

<a name="sect51">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>5.1 Application Command Definitions</h2>

<p>Strangely, you add the application to EMBOSS
before you write any source code. This is because EMBOSS can use the
application command definition (ACD) file to test all the input for you,
without any new source code.</p>

<a name="sect511">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>5.1.1 ACD files</h3>

<p>ACD files live in the <i>emboss/acd/</i>
directory with a filename or <i>appname</i>.acd ("<i>appname</i>" is
the name of your application). You will find some files there already which you
are welcome to use as templates for your own ACD file.</p>

<pre>
application: appname
</pre>

<p>Defines the application name. All ACD files
start this way.</p>

<pre>
sequence: sequence [
    parameter: Y
  ]
</pre>

<p>This asks for a sequence as the first parameter
on the command line.</p>

<pre>
outfile: outfile [
    parameter: Y
  ] 
</pre>

<p>This asks for an output file name as the second
parameter on the command line.</p>

<pre>
integer: weight [
  ]
</pre>

<p>Allows an integer value to be specified by
"-weight" on the command line. It will not be prompted for unless you
add "standard:Y", in which case you should add "prompt: 'prompt
for the user'" as well.</p>

<p>There are other things you can specify too. All
values can have defaults provided in the ACD file and tests to make sure the
values are reasonable. See the ACD documentation for more information.</p>

<a name="sect512">&nbsp;</a>
<h3>5.1.2 Testing your ACD file</h3>

<p>Now for the cunning part. EMBOSS has an
application called <b>acdc</b> which can pretend to be any other application.
You put</p>

<pre>
% <b>acdc</b> appname
</pre>

<p>on the command line. It will read <i>appname.acd</i>
and will read in any required data just as if the application itself was
running. It will also test anything else you add on the command line and report
syntax errors in exactly the same way as the real application.</p>

<a name="sect52">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>5.2 Application template</h2>

<p>When the ACD file is ready, which should not take long, you can
start on the application code. This lives in emboss/<i>appname</i>.c
and to start with you will simply call the startup routines and pick
up the values you defined in the ACD file.</p>

<pre>
#include "emboss.h"
AjPSeq seq;
AjPFile outfile;
int iweight;

int main (int argc, char * argv[]) {

  embInit ("appname", argc, argv);
  seq = ajAcdGetSeq ("sequence");
  outfile = ajAcdGetOutfile ("outfile");
  iweight = ajAcdGetInt ("weight");

  ajExit();
}
</pre>

<p>The "embInit" call is exactly what <b>acdc</b>
was doing. It will read <i>appname.acd</i> and read everything you need from
the command line or by prompting the user.</p>

<p>The next 3 lines pick up the sequence, output
file and integer value in the suggested ACD file (you will have your own set of
calls here).</p>

<p>Now you are ready to write your code. The sequence is in seq in an
internal representation. You can use EMBOSS functions to work with
this sequence, or convert it to a string and use the string functions,
or convert it to a null-terminated C character string and use the C
library functions and C pointers. It does not really matter which you
choose.</p>

<p>All output will be written to outfile. You should use the EMBOSS
output functions to do this, typically ajFmtPrintF which works just
like C's "printf" except that it uses an AJAX file object (AjPFile)
and has some extra format options like %S for AJAX strings
(AjPStr).</p>

<a name="sect53">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>5.3 Makefile changes</h2>

<p>You can add a new application without too much
difficulty if you are using the full developers version from the CVS server. Go
to the emboss directory (/emboss). Edit file <i>Makefile.am</i> and make two
changes. Add <i>appname</i> to the list of applications in bin_PROGRAMS and add
a new line:</p>

<pre>
appname_SOURCES = appname.c
</pre>

<p>Then go back up to the top directory ( emboss/,
and run <i>./configure</i> which will magically update the makefiles for you.
You can then use <i>make</i> to make EMBOSS with your new application.</p>

<p>What next?</p>

<p>Time to write some real code for your
application. Good luck and happy coding!</p>

<a name="sect6">&nbsp;</a>
<h1>6. Examples</h1>

<p>The following ACD file for a hypothetical
application called <b>ajtest</b> tests the data types for both required and
optional values. The application will prompt for one value of each data type,
in the order in which they are defined, and will accept definitions of the
optional data on the command line.</p>

<pre>
# AJTEST application
# AJAX COMMAND DEFINITION (ACD) FILE
# use "" for missing values - these are required.
# values in "" are trimmed to single spaces.
# everything is treated as single tokens delimited by white space
# (space, tab, newline)
# pmr 8-jul-98

application: ajtest [
    documentation: "Testing ACD files"
    groups: "Test"
  ]

    default: Y
    standard: Y
    information: "Required bool"
  ]

  ]

    parameter: Y
  ]

    default: "abcd"
    standard: Y
    information: "rqstring"
    minlen: 4
  ]

    default: "b"
    information: "string"
    minlen: 1
    maxlen: 50

</pre>


<a name="sect61">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>6.1 Processing the ACD File</h2>

<p>The AJAX Command Definition, and the command
line entered by the user, are processed automatically by a single start-up call
to <i>embInit</i>. The same call also handles all prompting of the user for
missing information.</p>

<a name="sect62">&nbsp;</a>
<h2>6.2 Testing ACD Files</h2>

<p>To help in evaluating the ACD files, there is a
special EMBOSS application <b>acdc</b> (the ACD compiler) which, when given the
name of an ACD file as the first argument on the command line, will process
that file and use the remainder of the command line. This causes <b>acdc</b> to
behave exactly like any (possibly not yet written) application and makes it
very easy to test how a particular application could be defined.</p>

<p>For example</p>

<pre>
% <b>acdc</b> ajtest
</pre>

<p>would use the example ACD file above and would
prompt for each of the required data types:</p>

<pre>
% <b>acdc</b> ajtest
Testing ACD files
Required bool [Y] : 
Number -50 to 50 [0] : 
Float to 2.5 [0.0] : 
First sequence : gcg::egmsmg.gcg
Output file [stdout] : 
Second sequence : paamir.tfa
rqstring [abcd] : fred

% <b>acdc</b> ajtest -sask
Testing ACD files
Required bool [Y] : 
Number -50 to 50 [0] : 
Float to 2.5 [0.0] : 
First sequence : gcg::egmsmg.gcg
Begin at base [1] : 
End at base [1217] :
Reverse strand [N] : 
Output file [stdout] : 
Second sequence : paamir.tfa
Begin at base [1] : 
End at base [1000] : 
Reverse strand [N] : 
rqstring [abcd] : fred

% <b>acdc</b> ajtest -noreqb -reqf=1.5 <i>egmsmg.gcg</i> -sformat gcg
Testing ACD files
Number -50 to 50 [0] : 
Output file [stdout] : 
Second sequence : paamir.tfa
rqstring [abcd] : fred

% <b>acdc</b> ajtest -reqst=xyz
Testing ACD files
Required bool [Y] : 
Number -50 to 50 [0] : 
Float to 2.5 [0.0] : 
First sequence : gcg:egmsmg.gcg
Output file [stdout] : 
Second sequence : paamir.tfa

<h1>Footnotes</h1>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>
<a href="#fnB1">[1]</a>
Input (and output) will usually take place using files, but 'files' is
used here in the broadest sense, since there are many different ways
that the input can actually take place (via the USA method).</p>

<p><a name="fn2"></a>
<a href="#fnB2">[2]</a>
The global qualifiers all default to 'false' at this moment, so there
is no compelling reason to use this syntax.</p>

<h2>Notes:</h2>

<p>Need to add qualifier_assocqualifier syntax</p>

<p>Need to add a lot more on features input and
output and notes on features in reports</p>

<p>Check details for ranges - can we add some attributes
e.g. forwardonly so range appears in the tables</p>

<p>Check the -nooutput option in the example(s)</p>

<p>acd error checks - list and example for each - and how to log and
debug the details</p>

<p>cpdb, scop should all use name and extension attributes
- makes more sense than just name. Only codon should have a default.</p>

<p>datafile - does extension get added to anything the user specifies?
always, only if it has no extension? </p>
