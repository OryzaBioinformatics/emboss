GPROF run-time profiling
========================

Build EMBOSS with configure option --with-gcov and --disable-shared

Building generates .gcno files with each object file.

Run an application. It will generate count files

cd to the directory where the source and object files are.

gcov with the name of the object file (the soruce file name does not get converted right.

% (e.g.) fuzzpro ... reading swissprot .dat file with a pattern query
% cd ajax/core
% gcov libajax_la-ajfileio.o
File 'ajfileio.c'
Lines executed:31.12% of 331
ajfileio.c:creating 'ajfileio.c.gcov'

Look in this file for coverage counts against each record. Skipped
lines with if/then/else have ####, executed lines have the number of
times they were used in the all runs to date.

Delete the .gcda file in the source directory, or rebuild to reset the
counts if you are interested in just a single run.
