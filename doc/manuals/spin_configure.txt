Staden Package SPIN and EMBOSS

EMBOSS applications can be run from the Staden Package under the SPIN
interface.

The configurations are stored in the following text files:

tables/emboss_menu

Builds the menus by adding each EMBOSS program with its group and
documentation string.

lib/spin2_emboss/acd2tcl.tcl

Converts the ACD file into a tcl script

Includes the code to run graph with the -data and possibly -outfile
fix.

Has a hack for alternative -data options.
