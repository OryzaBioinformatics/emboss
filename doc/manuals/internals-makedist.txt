Making a distribution

Need to start with a fresh checkout. In particular, the jemboss/build
directory otherwise contains full path names to olong to save in the
standard tar format (99 characters starting with EMBOSS-6.5.0/)


Then in the top level:

# rsync to pick up the data and index files

rsync -ac rsync://emboss.open-bio.org/EMBOSS/ .

# autoreconf to create the configure file

autoreconf -fi

# configure with default options to create a make file

./configure

# Add a line to NEWS to describe the new release
15/07/2012	Version 6.5.0  See ChangeLog

# Create the distribution file

make dist
