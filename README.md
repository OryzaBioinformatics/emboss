European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite

This repository is the new development home for the EMBOSS project.

Versions up to 6.6.0 were developed using the Open Bio Foundation's
CVS server, and before that the CVS server of the Rosalind Franklin
Institute (formerly HGMP-RC) in Hinxton, UK. Unfortunately a system
crash lost our archive and the details of the changes.

This repository is constructed using the earliest releases we have
available so the changes in each release will be clear though we have
lost the attributions for changes by each of the developers.
