EMBREO - transparent access to remote application services

Copyright (C) 2001  Peter C. Tribble


EMBREO is a system for accessing applications and data on remote
computer systems. It is independent of application, communication
protocol, language, hardware, and operating system.

It's a work in progress, and this is 1.0 beta 1. It's not bug free, nor
is it feature complete. It is, however, reasonably stable and we're
using it for real work.

The sample implementation consists of a CGI based perl server using
SOAP::LITE, and a Java based client, all using SOAP for
communication. We have also had some success with using Java servlets
on the server, and perl and Tcl/Tk on the client side, and python
should work as well.

The primary implementation is Jemboss, the Java EMBOSS client, which
uses the Embreo library for all its SOAP calls. That is supplied
separately, as part of EMBOSS. However, a sample EMBOSS client is
supplied here in the Client directory.

To use the java components, you will need a Java Virtual Machine,
version 1.3 or later, and the jar files in the libs directory. If
you're using Embreo on a Windows client machine, then the best way to
proceed is to get Java Web Start from Sun
(http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/index.html) which includes
the right version of Java, and launch the applications using jnlp.

To run the perl server, you'll need SOAP::LITE (http://www.soaplite.com/)
and you need to edit cgi-bin/soap.cgi and the *.pm files in the Modules
directory, and install them on a web server.

News, further documentation, and updates will be posted on the Embreo
home page:
