Classic MacOS simply won't work; an adequately recent version of Java
simply isn't available.

MacOS X (10.1, anyway) should work fine, as it comes with Java 1.3 and
Java Web Start by default. There's a snag, however - an old and
incompatible XML parser is also included by Apple, and that breaks our
SOAP classes, so while the client starts up, it bombs out as soon as it
tries to make a SOAP call.

So we haven't yet succeeded in getting Embreo to work on a Mac.
