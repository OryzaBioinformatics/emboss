EMBREO - transparent access to remote application services

Copyright (C) 2001  Peter C. Tribble


These are the perl modules for the cgi based perl server.

ParseSoapOptions.pm is a little module used by the other modules; it's
not a soap server.

EmbossSoap is a full implementation of the Emboss service; it's the
default server for the Embreo sample client.

EmbreoFile is the Embreo file manager.

Directory names and file locations will need to be modified for use
outside the HGMP.
