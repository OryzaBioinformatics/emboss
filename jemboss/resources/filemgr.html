<h1>Local and Remote File Manager</h1></center>

<p><br>The users local and the remote file systems are
displayed. The local files are those stored on the computer
the Jemboss file manager is being run on. The remote files 
are the users files located on the server machine.

<h2>Transferring Files</h2>
Files can be transferred between the two file systems. 
Select the file that you want to transfer. Drag it into 
the other file manager until a file in the directory or
the directory node you want the file to be put in is
highlighted. The file will then appear in that file system.
<br>&nbsp;<h2>Displaying File</h2>
Double click on the file you want to display on the screen.
<br>&nbsp;<h2>Saving Files</h2>
When a file is opened and displayed it can be saved to the
local file system. Goto the "File" menu and click on "Save".
<br>&nbsp;<h2>
Refresh, Rename, New Folder, Delete Using the popup Menu</h2>
Right click on one of the file systems and a popup menu 
appears. This allows the user to rename and delete files, 
also directories can be created. To carry out these functions
a file needs to be selected that will be renamed or deleted.

directory which the new folder will be created.
