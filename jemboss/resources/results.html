<h1>Jemboss Results Manager</h1>

Applications in Jemboss can be run <b>'interactively'</b>
or in <b>'batch'</b> mode. A default mode is given, and
is based on the length of time it is likely to run for.
If it is a short program it is run interactively or if
it is usually a medium or long program batch is used.

<p>
Interactive applications wait for the process to finish 
and the results pop up on the screen. Batch process run in
the background so that other tasks can be performed in 
Jemboss while the application is running. In both cases the
results are stored on the server machine and can be retieved
at any time.

<p>
To retrieve the results from applications run previously,
go to the 'File' menu and select 'Saved Results'. A list
of all the previous runs is then presented in a separate 
window from which individual runs can be viewed or deleted.
On the right hand side of this window the run details are
provided with the parameters used.

<p>
Batch results are monitored by the 'Job Manager' in the 
bar at the bottom of the main Jemboss window. This provides
the current status of batch processes (i.e. running or 
completed). Clicking on this bar opens the results manager
for the batch processes in that session. On completion
batch results can be viewed by double clicking on the 
program in the list.
