Jemboss - An Interface To EMBOSS

Copyright (C) 2002 Tim Carver

Jemboss is a Java interface to EMBOSS, developed at
the HGMP-RC and in close collaboration with the EMBOSS
development team. It is distributed as part of the EMBOSS
software.

Documentation on Jemboss can be found at:

It is possible to setup, using the code in the Jemboss 
distribution, a Jemboss server for your own site. All
documentation to do with setting up a client or a server
can be found at:

This is in on-going development and comments and suggestions
are welcome.
