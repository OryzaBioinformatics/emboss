#Nesting Features
#
#Many genomic features are discontinuous and have multiple
#subparts. GFF3 represents such features by linking the parts
#together with the Parent tag. For example, to represent an mRNA
#transcript that has five exons, we could write this:
#
#The first feature is an mRNA that extends from position 1300 to 9000
#in genomic coordinates. It has an ID of "mrna0001" and a
#human-readable name of "sonichedgehog" (note that the ID and the Name
#are not the same thing). This is followed by five exon features, each
#of which is linked to the mRNA using a Parent tag. When GBrowse
#displays this transcript, it will display each of the exons linked
#together by a solid line. The entire set can be found by searching
#for the name "sonichedgehog."
