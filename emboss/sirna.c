The siRNA user guide (revised October 11, 2002)

Selection of siRNA duplexes from the target mRNA sequence

Using Drosophila melanogaster lysates (Tuschl et al.  1999), we have
systematically analyzed the silencing efficiency of siRNA duplexes as a
function of the length of the siRNAs, the length of the overhang and the
sequence in the overhang (Elbashir et al.  2001c).  The most efficient
silencing was obtained with siRNA duplexes composed of 21-nt sense and
21-nt antisense strands, paired in a manner to have a 2-nt 3' overhang. 
The sequence of the 2-nt 3' overhang makes a small contribution to the
specificity of target recognition restricted to the unpaired nucleotide
adjacent to the first base pair.  2'-Deoxynucleotides in the 3'
overhangs are as efficient as ribonucleotides, but are often cheaper to
synthesize and probably more nuclease resistant.  We used to select
siRNA sequences with TT in the overhang. 

The targeted region is selected from a given cDNA sequence beginning 50
to 100 nt downstream of the start codon.  Initially, 5' or 3' UTRs and
regions nearby the start codon were avoided assuming that UTR-binding
proteins and/or translation initiation complexes may interfere with
binding of the siRNP or RISC endonuclease complex.  More recently,
however, we have targeted 3'-UTRs and have not experienced any problems
in knocking down the targeted genes.  In order to design a siRNA duplex,
we search for the 23-nt sequence motif AA(N19)TT (N, any nucleotide) and
select hits with approx.  50% G/C-content (30% to 70% has also worked in
our hands).  If no suitable sequences are found, the search is extended
using the motif NA(N21).  The sequence of the sense siRNA corresponds to
(N19)TT or N21 (position 3 to 23 of the 23-nt motif), respectively.  In
the latter case, we convert the 3' end of the sense siRNA to TT.  The
rationale for this sequence conversion is to generate a symmetric duplex
with respect to the sequence composition of the sense and antisense 3'
overhangs.  The antisense siRNA is synthesized as the complement to
position 1 to 21 of the 23-nt motif.  Because position 1 of the 23-nt
motif is not recognized sequence-specifically by the antisense siRNA,
the 3'-most nucleotide residue of the antisense siRNA, can be chosen
deliberately.  However, the penultimate nucleotide of the antisense
siRNA (complementary to position 2 of the 23-nt motif) should always be
complementary to the targeted sequence.  For simplifying chemical
synthesis, we always use TT.  More recently, we preferentially select
siRNAs corresponding to the target motif NAR(N17)YNN, where R is purine
(A, G) and Y is pyrimidine (C, U).  The respective 21-nt sense and
antisense siRNAs therefore begin with a purine nucleotide and can also
be expressed from pol III expression vectors without a change in
targeting site; expression of RNAs from pol III promoters is only
efficient when the first transcribed nucleotide is a purine. 

We always design siRNAs with symmetric 3' TT overhangs, believing that
symmetric 3' overhangs help to ensure that the siRNPs are formed with
approximately equal ratios of sense and antisense target RNA-cleaving
siRNPs (Elbashir et al.  2001b; Elbashir et al.  2001c).  Please note
that the modification of the overhang of the sense sequence of the siRNA
duplex is not expected to affect targeted mRNA recognition, as the
antisense siRNA strand guides target recognition.  In summary, no matter
what you do to your overhangs, siRNAs should still function to a
reasonable extent.  However, using TT in the 3' overhang will always
help your RNA synthesis company to let you know when you accidentally
order a siRNA sequences 3' to 5' rather than in the recommended format
of 5' to 3'.  You may think this is funny, but it has happened quite a
lot. 

Compared to antisense or ribozyme technology, the secondary structure of
the target mRNA does not appear to have a strong effect on silencing. 
We say that, because we have already knocked-down more than 20 genes
using a single, essentially randomly chosen siRNA duplex (Harborth et
al.  2001).  Only 3 siRNA duplexes have been ineffective so far.  In one
or two other cases, we have found siRNAs to be inactive because the
targeting site contained a single-nucleotide polymorphism.  We were also
able to knock-down two genes simultaneously (e.g.  lamin A/C and NuMA)
by using equal concentrations of siRNA duplexes. 

We recommend to blast-search (NCBI database) the selected siRNA sequence
against EST libraries to ensure that only one gene is targeted.  In
addition, we also recommend to knock-down your gene with two independent
siRNA duplexes to control for specificity of the silencing effect.  If
selected siRNA duplexes do not function for silencing, please check for
sequencing errors of the gene, polymorphisms, and whether your cell line
is really from the expected species.  Our initial studies on the
specificity of target recognition by siRNA duplexes indicate that a
single point mutation located in the paired region of an siRNA duplex is
sufficient to abolish target mRNA degradation (Elbashir et al.  2001c). 
Furthermore, it is unknown if targeting of a gene by two different siRNA
duplexes is more effective than using a single siRNA duplex.  We think
that the amount of siRNA-associating proteins is limiting for silencing
rather than the target accessibility.

siRNA description from http://www.oligoengine.com/
30 October 2002

siRNA: Background and Applications RNA interference, or RNAi, is a
phenomenon in which double stranded RNA (dsRNA) effects silencing of the
expression of genes that are highly homologous to either of the RNA
strands in the duplex.  Gene silencing in RNAi results from the
degradation of mRNA sequences, and the effect has been used to determine
the function of many genes in Drosophilia, C.  elegans, and many plant
species. 

The duration of knockdown by siRNA can typically last for 7-10 days, and
has been shown to transfer to daughter cells.  Of further note, siRNAs
are effective at quantities much lower than alternative gene silencing
methodologies, including antisense and ribozyme based strategies. 
 
Considerable interest has developed in RNAi lately among life science
professionals.  The ability to quickly and easily generate
loss-of-function phenotypes in mammalian cells has spawned a new wave of
research endeavors; companies are also exploring the potential of siRNA
for use in drug development and gene-specific therapeutics. 
 
Due to various mechanisms of antiviral response to long dsRNA, RNAi at
first proved more difficult to establish in mammalian species.  Then,
Tuschl, Elbashir, and others discovered that RNAi can be elicited very
effectively by well-defined 21-base duplex RNAs.  When these small
interfering RNA, or siRNA, are added in duplex form with a transfection
agent to mammalian cell cultures, the 21-base-pair RNA acts in concert
with cellular components to silence the gene with sequence homology to
one of the siRNA sequences.

Strategies for the design of effective siRNA sequences have been
recently documented, most notably by Sayda Elbashir, Thomas Tuschl, et
al.  Like all of the design applications in the OligoEngine Platform,
our siRNA Design Tool transforms these strategies into an automated
process that improves accuracy, saves time, and provides valuable
feedback to the user. 
        
In brief, the Tool analyzes a user's gene sequence and applies various
algorithms to generate "candidate" siRNA sequences that are 19
nucleotides in length.  Users then select the 2-nt 3' overhang to order
two (sense and antisense) 21-nucleotide RNA oligos. 
 
Use either:

1) Type the accession number of a GenBank mRNA file associated with your
gene of interest.  (Hint: for best results, use a GenBank file with
complete CDS)
        
2) Copy a complete mRNA sequence from another file and use the "Paste
Sequence" button to quickly input your sequence. 
       
Next, select the general parameters for siRNA design.  These include:
 
GC Content: 50% is optimal, and the Tool uses a default range of 45-55%. 
You can set parameters from 30-70%, the max range for potentially
effective siRNA. 

Leader: The tool uses AA as its default, the widely accepted standard
for the dinucleotide leader.  CA leaders can also be effective and may
be provide a broader range of options, especially when searching for a
sequence homologous to two related genes. 
 
UTR Search: While we do not recommend siRNA candidates targeting 5' or
3' UTR regions, the Tool gives users the option to design in UTRs (if
UTR sequences are available). 
 
ORF length: For paste-in sequences, the Tool first predicts the ORF to
ensure siRNA design within the coding region.  Setting a minimum ORF
length helps to make an accurate prediction and account for "false" stop
codons inside the CDS. 


 
Choose the 3' overhang: Click to select dTdT (default setting and
generally recommended choice) or UU.  Contact us for other custom
overhang options if required. 
 
BLAST your siRNA: click the BLAST button to check for sequence homology
against our local NCBI genome databases.  When complete, the button will
turn green- click it to view the BLAST results in a separate screen
(reports on any siRNA you purchase are saved for your future review). 


As mentioned, the siRNA Design Tool is based on guidelines developed by
leading researchers in the study of siRNA and RNAi: chiefly, Sayda
Elbashir, Thomas Tuschl, and their coworkers.  These in turn were
developed based on systematic analyses of the structural and functional
requirements of siRNA duplexes in Drosophila cell free lysates. 
 
They have systematically analyzed the silencing efficiency of siRNA
duplexes as a function of the length of the siRNAs, the length of the
3'-overhangs, and the sequence in the overhangs.  More specifically, the
most effective siRNA were those where:
 
The duplexes are composed of 21-nucleotide sense and 21-nt antisense
strands, paired in a manner to have a 19-nt duplex region and a 2-nt
overhang at each 3'-terminus. 
 
The sense strand of the 19-nt duplex is homologous to the target gene. 
 
The 3'-overhangs contain either UU or dTdT dinucleotides. 
 
The overhangs ensure that the sequence-specific endonuclease complexes
(siRNPs) are formed with approximately equal ratios of sense and
antisense target RNA cleaving siRNPs. 
 
The 3'-overhang in the sense strand provides no contribution to
recognition as it is believed the antisense siRNA strand guides target
recognition.  Therefore, 3'-overhang of the antisense sequences is
complementary to the target mRNA but the symmetrical 3'-overhang of the
sense siRNA oligo does not need to correspond to the mRNA.  The use of
deoxythymidines in both 3'-overhangs may increase nuclease resistance,
although siRNA duplexes with either UU or dTdT overhangs have both
proven effective. 
 
It is recommended that the targeted region of the mRNA is within the
ORF.  Both the 5' and 3' UTRs and regions near the start codon are not
recommended for targeting as these may be richer in regulatory protein
binding sites; UTR-binding proteins and/or translation initiation
complexes may interfere with binding of the siRNP endonuclease complex. 
(However, because these guidelines continue to evolve and be refined,
the Tool gives users the option to search for targets within the UTRs if
so desired.)
 
Taking these above characteristics and phenomena into account, the
general strategy for siRNA sequence design is summarized in the box at
right. 
 
To date, successful silencing has been achieved using this strategy to
select the target sequence.  Based on feedback from customers and
collaborators where transfection conditions have been optimized, siRNA
duplexes designed using this method will work 70-80% of the time.  This
percentage is consistent with reports from Tuschl, Elbashir, and others

siRNA Target Sequence Design

Introduction

Initial studies of mammalian RNAi suggest that the most efficient
gene-silencing effect is achieved using double-stranded siRNA having a
19-nucleotide complementary region and a 2-nucleotide 3' overhang at
each end (see examples below).  Current models of the RNAi mechanism
suggest that the antisense siRNA strand recognizes the specific gene
target. 

In gene-specific RNAi, the open reading frame segment of the mRNA is
usually targeted.  The search for an appropriate target sequence should
begin 50-100 nucleotides downstream of the start codon.  To avoid
interference from mRNA regulatory proteins, sequences in the 5' or 3'
untranslated region or near the start codon should not be targeted. 

Shortly after the first reports on the use of RNAi in mammalian cells, a
set of simple rules for siRNA target site selection were developed
(http://www.mpibpc.gwdg.de/abteilungen/100/105/sirna.html).  One key
feature in this early set of rules was the suggestion to look for
specific sequence motifs to find the most appropriate siRNA targets. 
This original set of rules suggested that siRNA target sites with the
sequence AA(N19)TT (Example 3) are the most appropriate target sequence. 
If an appropriate sequence could not be found, an AA(N21) (Example 1) or
CA(N21) sequence motif could be considered.  In these situations,
because the sense strand does not appear to be involved in target
recognition, the sequence of the sense strand can be synthesized with a
dTdT regardless of the target sequence. 

A number of laboratories have used these rules to create siRNA
oligonucleotides that successfully silenced target gene expression. 
However, based on feedback from multiple laboratories, it does not
appear that there is a strict need for the siRNA target sequence to
begin with AA. 

Based on the results of an extensive study of a single gene, in which
approximately 70 different siRNA oligonucleotide target sequences were
used for RNAi, we suggest a modified set of rules (see below).  The
results of this recent work, indicate that choosing a 21 nt region of
the mRNA with a GC content as close as possible to 50% is a more
important consideration than choosing a target sequence that begins with
AA.  Another key consideration in target selection is to avoid having
more than three guanosines in a row, since poly G sequences can
hyperstack and form agglomerates that potentially interfere with the
siRNA silencing mechanism.  It is recommended that these two rules be a
primary consideration when designing and siRNA. 

There are some advantages to using a target sequence that begins with
AA.  The use of a target sequence that begins with an AA allows dT
residues to be used to create the 3'-end of the siRNA, this simplifies
the synthesis and decreases the cost of the siRNA.  Although duplexes
synthesized with UU overhangs appear to work as well as dTdT overhangs,
oligonucleotides with a dTdT overhang cost less and are potentially more
resistant to nucleases.  However, if the GC content is higher than 60%
alternate regions of the coding region of the mRNA should be considered. 
Our suggestions for criteria to consider when designing an siRNA
oligonucleotide are summarized in the "new relaxed set of rules" below. 
In addition, examples of siRNA oligonucleotides that start with an AA
sequence as well as examples of siRNA oligonucleotides that do not are
given. 

Current Considerations for siRNA Design (19 complementary bases and 2
bases overhang)

1.Choose a 21 (Example 1) or a 23 (Example 2 and 3) nt sequence in the
coding region of the mRNA with a GC ratio as close to 50% as possible. 
Ideally the GC ratio will be between 45% and 55%.  An siRNA with 60% GC
content has worked in many cases, however when an siRNA with 70% GC
content is used for RNAi typically a sharp decrease in the level of
silencing is observed.  Avoid regions within 50-100 nt of the AUG start
codon or 50-100 nt of the termination codon. 
  
2.Avoid more than three guanosines in a row.  Poly G sequences can
hyperstack and therefore form agglomerates that potentially interfere in
the siRNA silencing mechanism. 
   
3.Preferentially choose target sequences that start with two adenosines
(Example 1).  This will make synthesis easier, more economical, and
create siRNA that is potentially more resistant to nucleases.  When a
sequence that starts with AA is used, siRNA with dTdT overhangs can be
produced.  If it is not possible to find a sequence that starts with AA
and matches rules 1and 2, choose any 23 nt region of the coding sequence
with a GC content between 45 and 55% that does not have more than three
guanosines in a row (Example 3). 
  
4.Ensure that your target sequence is not homologous to any other genes. 
It is strongly recommended that a BLAST search of the target sequence be
performed to prevent the silencing of unwanted genes with a similar
sequence. 
   
5.Based on feedback from various customers, labelling the 3'-end of the
sense strand gives the best results with respect to not interfering with
the gene silencing mechanism of siRNA.  Consult our custom siRNA page
for available modifications. 

When these rules are used for siRNA target sequence design RNAi
effectively silences genes in more than 80% of cases.  Current data
indicate that there are regions of some mRNAs where gene silencing does
not work.  To help ensure that a given target gene is silenced, it is
advised that at least two target sequences as far apart on the gene as
possible be chosen. 
   
This method does not take into account mRNA secondary structure.  At
present it does not appear that mRNA secondary structure has a
significant impact on gene silencing.
