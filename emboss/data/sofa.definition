term: group_II_intron
id: SO:0000603
definition: Group II introns are found in rRNA, tRNA and mRNA of organelles in fungi, plants and protists, and also in mRNA in bacteria. They are large self-splicing ribozymes and have 6 structural domains (usually designated dI to dVI). A subset of group II introns also encode essential splicing proteins in intronic ORFs. The length of these introns can therefore be up to 3kb. Splicing occurs in almost identical fashion to nuclear pre-mRNA splicing with two transesterification steps. The 2' hydroxyl of a bulged adenosine in domain VI attacks the 5' splice site, followed by nucleophilic attack on the 3' splice site by the 3' OH of the upstream exon. Protein machinery is required for splicing in vivo, and long range intron-intron and intron-exon interactions are important for splice site positioning. Group II introns are further sub-classified into groups IIA and IIB which differ in splice site consensus, distance of bulged A from 3' splice site, some tertiary interactions, and intronic ORF phylogeny.

term: group_I_intron
id: SO:0000587
definition: Group I catalytic introns are large self-splicing ribozymes. They catalyse their own excision from mRNA, tRNA and rRNA precursors in a wide range of organisms. The core secondary structure consists of 9 paired regions (P1-P9). These fold to essentially two domains, the P4-P6 domain (formed from the stacking of P5, P4, P6 and P6a helices) and the P3-P9 domain (formed from the P8, P3, P7 and P9 helices). Group I catalytic introns often have long ORFs inserted in loop regions.

Its best characterised activity is the generation of mature 5 prime ends of tRNAs by cleaving the 5 prime leader elements of precursor-tRNAs. Cellular RNase Ps are ribonucleoproteins. RNA from bacterial RNase Ps retains its catalytic activity in the absence of the protein subunit, i.e. it is a ribozyme. Isolated eukaryotic and archaeal RNase P RNA has not been shown to retain its catalytic function, but is still essential for the catalytic activity of the holoenzyme. Although the archaeal and eukaryotic holoenzymes have a much greater protein content than the bacterial ones, the RNA cores from all the three lineages are homologous. Helices corresponding to P1, P2, P3, P4, and P10/11 are common to all cellular RNase P RNAs. Yet, there is considerable sequence variation, particularly among the eukaryotic RNAs.

definition: 5.8S ribosomal RNA (5.8S rRNA) is a component of the large subunit of the eukaryotic ribosome. It is transcribed by RNA polymerase I as part of the 45S precursor that also contains 18S and 28S rRNA. Functionally, it is thought that 5.8S rRNA may be involved in ribosome translocation. It is also known to form covalent linkage to the p53 tumour suppressor protein. 5.8S rRNA is also found in archaea.

id: SO:0000652
definition: 5S ribosomal RNA (5S rRNA) is a component of the large ribosomal subunit in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, it is synthesised by RNA polymerase III (the other eukaryotic rRNAs are cleaved from a 45S precursor synthesised by RNA polymerase I). In Xenopus oocytes, it has been shown that fingers 4-7 of the nine-zinc finger transcription factor TFIIIA can bind to the central region of 5S RNA. Thus, in addition to positively regulating 5S rRNA transcription, TFIIIA also stabilises 5S rRNA until it is required for transcription.

term: snoRNA
id: SO:0000275
definition: Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are involved in the processing and modification of rRNA in the nucleolus. There are two main classes of snoRNAs: the box C/D class, and the box H/ACA class. U3 snoRNA is a member of the box C/D class. Indeed, the box C/D element is a subset of the six short sequence elements found in all U3 snoRNAs, namely boxes A, A', B, C, C', and D. The U3 snoRNA secondary structure is characterised by a small 5' domain (with boxes A and A'), and a larger 3' domain (with boxes B, C, C', and D), the two domains being linked by a single-stranded hinge. Boxes B and C form the B/C motif, which appears to be exclusive to U3 snoRNAs, and boxes C' and D form the C'/D motif. The latter is functionally similar to the C/D motifs found in other snoRNAs. The 5' domain and the hinge region act as a pre-rRNA-binding domain. The 3' domain has conserved protein-binding sites. Both the box B/C and box C'/D motifs are sufficient for nuclear retention of U3 snoRNA. The box C'/D motif is also necessary for nucleolar localization, stability and hypermethylation of U3 snoRNA. Both box B/C and C'/D motifs are involved in specific protein interactions and are necessary for the rRNA processing functions of U3 snoRNA.

term: SRP_RNA
id: SO:0000590
definition: The signal recognition particle (SRP) is a universally conserved ribonucleoprotein. It is involved in the co-translational targeting of proteins to membranes. The eukaryotic SRP consists of a 300-nucleotide 7S RNA and six proteins: SRPs 72, 68, 54, 19, 14, and 9. Archaeal SRP consists of a 7S RNA and homologues of the eukaryotic SRP19 and SRP54 proteins. In most eubacteria, the SRP consists of a 4.5S RNA and the Ffh protein (a homologue of the eukaryotic SRP54 protein). Eukaryotic and archaeal 7S RNAs have very similar secondary structures, with eight helical elements. These fold into the Alu and S domains, separated by a long linker region. Eubacterial SRP is generally a simpler structure, with the M domain of Ffh bound to a region of the 4.5S RNA that corresponds to helix 8 of the eukaryotic and archaeal SRP S domain. Some Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. Bacillus subtilis), however, have a larger SRP RNA that also has an Alu domain. The Alu domain is thought to mediate the peptide chain elongation retardation function of the SRP. The universally conserved helix which interacts with the SRP54/Ffh M domain mediates signal sequence recognition. In eukaryotes and archaea, the SRP19-helix 6 complex is thought to be involved in SRP assembly and stabilizes helix 8 for SRP54 binding.

Further hydrogen bonds mediate the characteristic L-shaped molecular structure. tRNAs have two regions of fundamental functional importance: the anti-codon, which is responsible for specific mRNA codon recognition, and the 3' end, to which the tRNA's corresponding amino acid is attached (by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases). tRNAs cope with the degeneracy of the genetic code in two manners: having more than one tRNA (with a specific anti-codon) for a particular amino acid; and 'wobble' base-pairing, i.e. permitting non-standard base-pairing at the 3rd anti-codon position.

term: U1_snRNA
id: SO:0000391
definition: U1 is a small nuclear RNA (snRNA) component of the spliceosome (involved in pre-mRNA splicing). Its 5' end forms complementary base pairs with the 5' splice junction, thus defining the 5' donor site of an intron. There are significant differences in sequence and secondary structure between metazoan and yeast U1 snRNAs, the latter being much longer (568 nucleotides as compared to 164 nucleotides in human). Nevertheless, secondary structure predictions suggest that all U1 snRNAs share a 'common core' consisting of helices I, II, the proximal region of III, and IV.

Complementary binding between U2 snRNA (in an area lying towards the 5' end but 3' to hairpin I) and the branchpoint sequence (BPS) of the intron results in the bulging out of an unpaired adenine, on the BPS, which initiates a nucleophilic attack at the intronic 5' splice site, thus starting the first of two transesterification reactions that mediate splicing.
