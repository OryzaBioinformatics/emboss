# Many features are plain text with a final qualifier in brackets We
# can represent these with /note plus a /comment for the part in
# brackets. 


# We could also implement specific qualifiers for each special format
# so we can parser the details for each feature, But what to do about
# new GFF versions of the same features with possibly bad formatting?

# REGION - Extent of a region of interest in the sequence

# CARBOHYD - Glycosylation site.
# This key describes the occurrence of the attachment of a  glycan (mono- or
# polysaccharide) to a residue of the protein:
# 
# o The type of linkage (C- N- or O-linked) to the protein is indicated.
# o If  the nature of the reducing terminal sugar is known, its abbreviation
#   is   shown   between   parenthesis.  If  three  dots  "..."  follow  the
#   abbreviation this indicates extension of the carbohydrate chain.
#   Conversely the absence of the dots indicate that a single monosaccharide
#   is linked.
# Examples of CARBOHYD key feature lines:
# 
# FT   CARBOHYD     52     52       N-LINKED (GLCNAC...) (POTENTIAL).
# FT   CARBOHYD    162    162       O-LINKED (GLCNAC).
# FT   CARBOHYD     10     10       O-LINKED (GALNAC...) (BY SIMILARITY).
# FT   CARBOHYD     34     34       C-LINKED (MAN).

# CROSSLNK - Posttranslationally formed amino acid bonds.
# The 'FROM' and 'TO' endpoints designate the two residues, which are
# linked by an intrachain bond, and the description field indicates
# the nature of the cross-link. If the 'FROM' and 'TO' endpoints are
# identical, the amino acid bond is an interchain one. The name of the
# linked peptide is indicated in the description field.

# DISULFID - Disulfide bond.
# The  'FROM' and 'TO' endpoints represent the two residues which are linked
# by  an  intra-chain disulfide bond. If the 'FROM' and 'TO'  endpoints  are
# identical,  the  disulfide bond is an interchain one and  the  description
# field  indicates  the nature of the cross-link.
