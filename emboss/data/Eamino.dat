# Molecular weights of amino acids
# Also classified as:
#  Tiny, Small, Aliphatic, Aromatic, Non-polar, Polar, Charge, +ve, -ve
#
# Extinction coefficients are based on the values of Gill and von Hippel
# (1989) _Anal_Biochem_ 182 319-326.
# They are for proteins with full reduced cysteine residues.  If all
# cysteines are oxidized to cystine, use
# a value of 60 for C.
#
# Value for Selenocysteine calculated from Cysteine by replacing S
# with Se.
#
# J is an ambiguity code for Isoleucine or Leucine for Mass Spec data
# These have identical properties in this file.
#
# O is pyrrolysine in Archaea. Molecular weight from Expasy FindMod.
# Properties assumed to be the same as lysine
