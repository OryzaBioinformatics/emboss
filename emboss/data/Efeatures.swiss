# Feature types for SwissProt output

# From the Swiss-Prot users manual
# http://www.expasy.org/sprot/userman.html#FT_keys
# Last checked 2 Jun 2006

# Many features are plain text with a final qualifier in brackets We
# can represent these with /note plus a /comment for the part in
# brackets. 

# We could also implement specific qualifiers for each special format
# so we can parser the details for each feature, But what to do about
# new GFF versions of the same features with possibly bad formatting?

# The first type is used as the default if no match is found

# CARBOHYD - Glycosylation site.
# This key describes the occurrence of the attachment of a  glycan (mono- or
# polysaccharide) to a residue of the protein:
# 
# o The type of linkage (C- N- or O-linked) to the protein is indicated.
# o If  the nature of the reducing terminal sugar is known, its abbreviation
#   is   shown   between   parenthesis.  If  three  dots  "..."  follow  the
#   abbreviation this indicates extension of the carbohydrate chain.
#   Conversely the absence of the dots indicate that a single monosaccharide
#   is linked.
# Examples of CARBOHYD key feature lines:
# 
# FT   CARBOHYD     52     52       N-LINKED (GLCNAC...) (POTENTIAL).
# FT   CARBOHYD    162    162       O-LINKED (GLCNAC).

# CHAIN - Extent of a polypeptide chain in the mature protein.

# In Swiss-Prot, it is present:
# For proteins that are not processed
# (those for which the mature protein sequence corresponds to the
# translated cDNA sequence) the CHAIN covers the whole protein
# sequence
# For processed proteins, it describes the mature part of the protein
# once preprotein parts such as propeptides and signal sequences have
# been removed
#
# For TrEMBL, it is present only in those entries where the submitters
# to the nucleotide sequence databases have provided this information
# for processed proteins.

# INIT_MET - Initiator methionine.

# This feature key is usually associated with a zero value in the 'FROM'
# and 'TO' fields to indicate that the initiator methionine has been
# cleaved off and is not shown in the sequence. Usually there is no
# annotation in such cases.

# It is not used when the initiator methionine is not cleaved off except
# in the event of internal alternative initiation sites. Example:
# annotation "For isoform Cytoplasmic."
