#Multiple attributes of the same type are indicated by separating the
#values with the comma "," character, as in:
#
#       Parent=AF2312,AB2812,abc-3
#
#Note that attribute names are case sensitive.  "Parent" is not the
#same as "parent".
#
#All attributes that begin with an uppercase letter are reserved for
#later use.  Attributes that begin with a lowercase letter can be used
#freely by applications.

# Reserved attribute names
# ========================

# Indicates the name of the feature.  IDs must be unique within the
# scope of the GFF file.

ID

# Display name for the feature.  This is the name to be displayed to
# the user.  Unlike IDs, there is no requirement that the Name be
# unique within the file.

Name


# A secondary name for the feature.  It is suggested that this tag be
# used whenever a secondary identifier for the feature is needed, such
# as locus names and accession numbers.  Unlike ID, there is no
# requirement that Alias be unique within the file.

Alias

# Indicates the parent of the feature.  A parent ID can be used to
# group exons into transcripts, transcripts into genes, an so forth.
# A feature may have multiple parents.  Parent can *only* be used to
# indicate a partof relationship.

 Parent

# Indicates the target of a nucleotide-to-nucleotide or
# protein-to-nucleotide alignment.  The format of the value is
# "target_id start end [strand]", where strand is optional and may be
# "+" or "-".  If the target_id contains spaces, they must be escaped
# as hex escape %20.

Target

# The alignment of the feature to the target if the two are not
# collinear (e.g. contain gaps).  The alignment format is taken from
# the CIGAR format described in the Exonerate documentation.
# (http://cvsweb.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/exonerate
# ?cvsroot=Ensembl).  See "THE GAP ATTRIBUTE" for a description of
# this format.

Gap

# Used to disambiguate the relationship between one feature and
# another when the relationship is a temporal one rather than a purely
# structural "part of" one.  This is needed for polycistronic genes.
# See "PATHOLOGICAL CASES" for further discussion.
