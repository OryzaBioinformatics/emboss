# This code has been created for the mitochondrial genome of the labyrinthulid
# Thraustochytrium aureum sequenced by the The Organelle Genome Megasequencing
# Program (OGMP).
#
# It is the similar to the bacterial code (trans_table 11) but it contains an
# additional stop codon (TTA) and also has a different set of start codons.
