#include Etags.embl

# GFF allows multiple values up to a semicolon.
# we could define ANY for these special cases
# and LIMITED for those where we know the format

# We could also make ANY the default, as perhaps 'comment'

# GFF also allows # comments where we could hide non-conforming tags
# but then we lose the tag order.
