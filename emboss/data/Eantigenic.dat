# "A semi-emipirical method for prediction of antigenic determinants
# on protein antigens"
#
# TABLE 1: Occurrence of amino acids in epitopes, proteins and on the surface,
#         and their antigenic propensity, A(p), values
#
# 169 antigenic determinants experimentally determined. Selected those 156
# which have less than 20 amino acids per determinant (total 2066 residues).
# Calculated f(Ag) as frequency of occurrence of each residue in antigenic
# determinants [f(Ag) = Epitope_occurrence/2066].
#
# Used Hydrophilicity, Accessibility and Flexibility of Parker JMR, Guo D,
# Hodges, RS (1986) Biochemistry 25:5425-5432. In a given protein, calculated
# average for each 7-mer and assigned values to central residue of 7-mer.
# Residue considered to be on the surface if any of the 7-mer values was above
# the average for the protein. Used these results to get f(s) frequency of
# occurrence of amino acids at the surface.
#
# Antigenic propensity column A(p) = f(Ag)/f(s)
#
# f(s) values below were back-calculated from the table in the paper
#
# Prediction algorithm:
#
# 1. calculate average propensity <A(p)> for each overlapping 7-mer, assign to
#    central residue (i+3)
#
# 2. calculate average for whole protein A(p)av
#
# 3. (a) if average for whole protein >= 1.0 then all residues having
#        <A(p)> >= 1.0 are potentially antigenic.
#    (b) if average for whole protein <  1.0 then all residues having
#        <A(p)> > average for whole protein (??? paper has a mangled
#        formula here :-) are potentially antigenic.
#
# 4. Find 6-mers where all residues are selected by step 3 above
