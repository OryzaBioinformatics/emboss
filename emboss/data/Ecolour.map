# EMBOSS COLOUR MAPS
#
# The format of this file should be fairly self-explanatory.
#
# We want to make it possible for programs which display residues and
# bases in colour to have a standard set of colours to plot in. 
#
# We also want the user to have the ability to select different colour
# maps for different puposes or according to individual taste. 
#
# We want to make it easy for users to add to or amend the colour maps.
#
# We want to be able to set colours for both the PLPLOT (rather
# restricted) set of colours and for HTML which has a much larger set of
# available colours, even if we keep to the 'Safe PC/Mac WWW colours'
#
# Comment lines start with a '#'.
#
# Columns are separated by white space (one or more tabs and/or spaces)
#
# A colour map starts with the tag 'MAP' and is followed by the name of
# that map. 
#
# The default colour to use in that map is specified by 'default:'
# followed by the colour for PLPLOT. 
#
# The colours of the characters for the bases or residues are specified
# as for the 'default:' tag.  The characters are case independent. 
#
# Any characters whose colour has not been specified will use the
# default colour.
#
# The available PLPLOT plotting colours are:
# "BLACK", "RED", "YELLOW", "GREEN", "AQUAMARINE", "PINK", "WHEAT",
# "GREY", "BROWN", "BLUE", "BLUEVIOLET", "CYAN", "TURQUOISE", "MAGENTA",
# "SALMON", "WHITE"


# Define the colours as hexadecimal Red/Green/Blue values.
# This doesn't affect plotting device colours, only HTML colours.
#
# These are the nearest Safe PC/Mac WWW colour to the Netscape colour
# name.  They are all acceptable except for 'wheat' (F5E4C5).  I left it
# as FFFFCC, which is more of a light-yellow than I would like, but it
# will do as a default.

# Toby is colour-blind so there may be some slightly unusual choices.

# Safe PC/Mac WWW colours
# -----------------------
# 
# To be browser safe, for RGB you can use 0, 51, 102, 153, 204 or for
# hexadecimal 255 or 00, 33, 66, 99, CC, and FF in any combination in the
# three slots.  So 153 0 102 is the same as 990066 and produces a reddish
# purple. 
#
#
#Rasmol Amino Colours
#--------------------
#
#The RasMol `amino' colour scheme colours amino acids according to
#traditional amino acid properties. The purpose of colouring is to identify
#amino acids in an unusual or surprising environment. The outer parts of a
#protein that are polar are visible (bright) colours and non-polar residues
#darker. Most colours are hallowed by tradition. This colour scheme is
#similar to the `shapely' scheme.
#
#   ASP,GLU bright red [230,10,10]     CYS,MET     yellow [230,230,0]
#   LYS,ARG blue       [20,90,255]     SER,THR     orange [250,150,0]
#   PHE,TYR mid blue   [50,50,170]     ASN,GLN     cyan   [0,220,220]
#   GLY     light grey [235,235,235]   LEU,VAL,ILE green  [15,130,15]
#   ALA     dark grey  [200,200,200]   TRP         pink   [180,90,180]

#
#Rasmol Structure Colours
#------------------------
#    
#The RasMol `structure' colour scheme colours the molecule by protein
#secondary structure. Alpha helices are coloured magenta, [240,0,128], beta
#sheets are coloured yellow, [255,255,0], turns are coloured pale blue,   
#[96,128,255] and all other residues are coloured white. The secondary
#structure is either read from the PDB file (HELIX and SHEET records), if
#available, or determined using Kabsch and Sander's DSSP algorithm. The
#RasMol `structure' command may be used to force DSSP's structure assignment
#to be used.
