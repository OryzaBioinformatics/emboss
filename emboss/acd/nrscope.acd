        help: "The gap extension, penalty is added to the standard gap
penalty for each base or residue in the gap.  This is how long gaps are
penalized.  Usually you will expect a few long gaps rather than many
short gaps, so the gap extension penalty should be lower than the gap
penalty.  An exception is where one or both sequences are single reads
with possible sequencing errors in which case you would expect many
single base gaps.  You can get this result by setting the gap open
penalty to zero (or very low) and using the gap extension penalty to
control gap scoring."
