used in the PROSITE database.  For example: '[DE](2)HS{P}X(2)PX(2,4)C'
means two Asps or Glus in any order followed by His, Ser, any residue
other then Pro, then two of any residue followed by Pro followed by two
to four of any residue followed by Cys.  The search is case-independent,
so 'AAA' matches 'aaa'."
