           For example the terminal 4 A's of GCAGAAAA would be removed with
           the default values of -minlength=4 and -mismatches=1 (There are
           not at least 4 A's before the last 'G' and so only the A's after
           it are considered to be part of the tail). The terminal 9 bases of
           GCAAAAGAAAA would be removed; There are at least -minlength A's
           preceeding the last 'G', so it is part of the tail."

    help: "The poly-A region can be 'masked' by converting the sequence
           characters to lower-case. Some non-EMBOSS programs e.g. fasta can
           interpret this as a masked region. The sequence is unchanged apart
           from the case change. You might like to ensure that the whole
           sequence is in upper-case before masking the specified regions to
           lower-case by using the '-supper' sequence qualifier."
