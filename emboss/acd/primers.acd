# weight (see below) exceeds INTERNAL-OLIGO-MAX-MISHYB.  (The maximum
# value of the weight is arbitrarily set to 12.0.) \ Each sequence entry
# in the FASTA-format file must begin with an 'id line' that starts with

# Primer3 parses everything after any optional asterisk ('*') as a
# floating point number to use as the weight mentioned above.  If the id
# line contains no asterisk then the weight defaults to 1.0.  The
# alignment scoring system used is the same as for calculating
# complementarity among oligos (e.g.  SELF-ANY).  The remainder of an
