           more numerous and often vaguely phrased than the non-exploded
           ones. The exploded names are formed from definitions of the group
           names that start like NAME1:NAME2 and which are then expanded into
           many combinations of the names as: 'NAME1', 'NAME2', 'NAME1
           NAME2', NAME2 NAME1'. The non-expanded names are simply like:
           'NAME1 NAME2'. \
           Using expanded group names will find many more programs which
           share at least some of the expanded names than using the
           non-exploded names and so you will get more programs reported as
           sharing a similar function than you will if you specify that you
           wish to use non-exploded names"
