           or other of the two sequences must be used to create the merged
           sequence over this mismatch region. The default action is to
           create the merged sequence using the sequence where the mismatch
           is closest to that sequence's centre. If this option is used, then
           the first sequence (seqa) will always be used in preference to
           the other sequence when there is a mismatch."
