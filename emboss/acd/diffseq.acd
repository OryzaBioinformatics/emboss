           creating a hash table of 'wordsize'd subsequences. 10 is a
           reasonable default. Making this value larger (20?) may speed up
           the program slightly, but will mean that any two differences
           within 'wordsize' of each other will be grouped as a single region
           of difference. This value may be made smaller (4?) to improve the
           resolution of nearby differences, but the program will go much
           slower."
