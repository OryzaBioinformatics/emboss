           creating a hash table of 'wordsize'd subsequences. 10 is a
           reasonable default. Making this value larger (20?) may speed up
           the program slightly, but will mean that any two differences
           within 'wordsize' of each other will be grouped as a single region
           of difference. This value may be made smaller (4?) to improve the
           resolution of nearby differences, but the program will go much
           slower."

           This works well and is what most people want if they are working
           with long overlapping nucleic acid sequences. You are usually not
           interested in the non-overlapping ends of these sequences. If you
           have protein sequences or short RNA sequences however, you will be
           interested in differences at the very ends . It this option is
           set to be true then the differences at the ends will also be
           reported."
