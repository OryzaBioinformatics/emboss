           how long gaps are penalized. Usually you will expect a few long
           gaps rather than many short gaps, so the gap extension penalty
           should be lower than the gap penalty. An exception is where one or
           both sequences are single reads with possible sequencing errors
           in which case you would expect many single base gaps. You can get
           this result by setting the gap penalty to zero (or very low) and
           using the gap extension penalty to control gap scoring."
