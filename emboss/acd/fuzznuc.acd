    help: "The standard IUPAC one-letter codes for the nucleotides are
           used. \
           The symbol 'n' is used for a position where any nucleotide is
           accepted. \
           Ambiguities are indicated by listing the acceptable nucleotides
           for a given position, between square parentheses '[ ]'. For
           example: [ACG] stands for A or C or G. \
           Ambiguities are also indicated by listing between a pair of curly
           brackets '{ }' the nucleotides that are not accepted at a given
           position. For example: {AG} stands for any nucleotides except A
           and G. \
           Each element in a pattern is separated from its neighbor by a '-'.
           (Optional in fuzznuc). \
           Repetition of an element of the pattern can be indicated by
           following that element with a numerical value or a numerical range
           between parenthesis. Examples: N(3) corresponds to N-N-N, N(2,4)
           corresponds to N-N or N-N-N or N-N-N-N. \
           When a pattern is restricted to either the 5' or 3' end of a
           sequence, that pattern either starts with a '<' symbol or
           respectively ends with a '>' symbol. \
           A period ends the pattern. (Optional in fuzznuc). \
           For example, [CG](5)TG{A}N(1,5)C"
