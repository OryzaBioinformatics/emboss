    help: "In their paper, GOR mention that if you know something
           about the secondary structure content of the protein you are
           analyzing, you can do better in prediction. 'idc' is an index into
           a set of arrays, dharr[] and dsarr[], which provide 'decision
           constants' (dch, dcs), which are offsets that are applied to the
           weights for the helix and sheet (extend) terms. So, idc=0 says
           don't use the decision constant offsets, and idc=1 to 6 indicates
           that various combinations of dch,dcs offsets should be used."
