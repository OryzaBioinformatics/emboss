match a set of other sequences, then you can specify that set of
sequences here.  For example, if you require that the mutated sequence
should not be the same as the input sequence, enter the input sequence
here.  If you want the result to be different to previous results of
this program, specify the previous result sequences here.  The program
will check that the result does not match the sequences specified here
before writing it out.  If a match is found, then the mutation is
started again with a fresh copy of the input sequence.  If, after 10
such retries, there is still a match to the set of sequence given here,
then the matching mutated sequence is written with a warning message."
